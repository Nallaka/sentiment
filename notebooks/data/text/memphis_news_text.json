MEMPHIS Tenn.  A group seeing a rising number of opioid overdoses is black men.
This as the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is warning those who take prescription drugs about pills laced with fentanyl unknown to the user.
The TBI said if youre buying pills on the street in Tennessee youre gambling your life away. Officials said theres an influx of counterfeit pills in the states illicit drug supplies.
According to the Shelby County Health Department in 2020 black men represented 37 of opioid-related emergency department visits. In 2021 so far its been 26.
Brad Yackey with non-profit A Betor Way said job loss and the pandemic may exacerbate the issue.
Weve seen the numbers rise drastically especially in the African-American population Yackey said. Maybe somebody had a prescription for oxycodone and they go to the streets because they ran out and its filled with fentanyl.
Yackey who is a drug addict survivor said most of the time people cant distinguish the real pills from fake ones which are filled with opioids like fentanyl.
Fentanyls so cheap to the manufacturer and the return on it is that much more money in their pockets said Yackey. So its more about a greed thing.
The nonprofit volunteer said before fentanyl was mass-produced you didnt see as many fake pills being sold.
Yackey previously hurt his back and after his pain specialist lost his license he became hooked on pain medication. He eventually switching to heroin. Hes now in a 12-step program.
Coming out of addiction strips you of all your humanity. Really you dont even know how to tie your shoes somedays.
Now Yackey is helping others overcome their drug addictions.
He shared what he hears most often from those overcoming their addiction.
That they didnt know that this type of life was possible explained Yackey. They thought theyd be a prey to misery and depression their whole life. In my group we go out bowling to eat concerts - you name it.
Health officials said intense stressful periods like the pandemic can lead to an increase in adverse coping mechanisms.
There is still such a stigma for an IV African-American user said Yackey. We serve several but in large its frowned upon. So maybe a pill that looks like its prescription its not a stigma. So I think thats where its coming into play.
Those who are using may get combative begin to isolate or display a change in behavior.
A needle exchange event will be held off Shelby Oaks Drive this Friday beginning at 6 p.m.
Theres no name for parents whove lost children.
And there was no local support group for parents whove lost children to the opioid crisis either until a couple of grieving mothers made it happen.
Theres nothing in Tipton County that parents whove lost their children go to to get support from each other to be able to talk out your grief said Lori Green-Laird.

Her son died only eight months ago.
Austin was known by a lot of people in Tipton County he was so funny she said. If you were to meet him on the street you wouldnt know he was an addict. He hid it very well.
A 2010 graduate of Brighton High School he earned two associates degrees and worked as a chef at several restaurants in Memphis. He has two daughters.
The partying began in high school his mother said. She warned him about it but he was soon addicted to 30mg Percocet pills.
This went on for several years  I knew he was dabbling but I didnt know with what and I didnt know how to stop it.
The 28-year-old had been to rehab in California twice and sought help once he returned home. Local churches have support groups for recovering addicts but he wanted a more confidential setting.
He didnt want people in the community to talk Lori said.
During the early stages of the pandemic his mental health declined further for several reasons.
He spiraled into a deeper depression  Lori said.
He overdosed on May 14 after taking pills laced with the synthetic opioid Fentanyl which can cause respiratory distress and death.
A Tipton County Sheriffs Deputy saved his life by administering Narcan a nasal spray which is used to combat overdoses. Each deputy and most law enforcement officers in the county carry two doses each.
Unfortunately after they overdose they dont remember anything so he said Oh Mom it was nothing 
Shed hoped it was a new lease on life for her beloved son but it wasnt.
Nine days later he posted Who wants to hangout I really need someone to talk to on his Facebook page.
He and his best friend later met someone a drug dealer Lori said is from Tipton County but sells in Memphis and left with a different drug in place of the Percocets.
She was apparently in the shower and he had fallen out into the floor in the kitchen.
This time deputies were unable to revive Austin. He died on May 24.
The toxicology reports confirmed he had toxic levels of Fentanyl and Alprazolam in his system.
Ethan
Leslie Owen also lost her son to a drug overdose.
Weve lived here forever she said as she begins to talk about Ethan 21 who died on Nov. 2 2019. He went all the way through school here kindergarten through high school. He played rec ball with the Tipton Twisters 
Ethan graduated from Brighton in 2016 then went to work. He loved hunting and he loved his family and friends.
Leslie became emotional as she shared she was very close to her only son the baby of the family.
He was a special guy and I dont want his memory sullied because of his death. He just lost his way and we were trying to help him  
The day he died he and a friend drove to Memphis to meet a dealer believed to be the same man who sold drugs to Loris son and Ethan got into his car. They drove away and when they returned Ethan had pills.
He took them overnight and didnt wake up the next morning.
Those pills were also laced with Fentanyl.
Leslie considers it a homicide but said because the friend didnt see the exchange the dealer cannot be prosecuted.
No one put a drug in my sons mouth but it wasnt what he thought it was.
Now out of the fog of grief that immediately follows a parents worst nightmare Leslie and Lori have teamed up with Susan Hatfield and are on a mission.
This is a passion of mine Leslie said through tears. This is my crusade.
Safe Harbor
The group which is still in its infancy is called Safe Harbor Tipton County. Its purpose is to provide a place for parents to grieve their children in a confidential way to talk to others who understand and to lean on one another for support.
We want to let parents know theyre not alone in this Leslie said. There was no one local you could just reach out to because theres so much of a stigma when your child dies like this.
Lori said they want to erase that stigma as much as they possibly can.
Grief comes in waves you may have good days you may have bad days. We all just talk about that and encourage each other and support each other.
So far there are four other members and they invite anyone interested to join them.
We know there are so many more than just four of us Lori added.
Austins was the sixth overdose of nine recorded through the Tipton County Sheriffs Office in 2020. The surrounding cities have separate overdose statistics that are not yet finalized.
From 2016-2019 58 Tipton Countians died due to an opioid overdose according to the non-profit Drug Free Tipton. In 2019 when Ethan died there were 18 deaths.
Lori and Leslie invite these other parents to join them.
There is a private Safe Harbor Tipton County Facebook group and there are meetings on the fourth Tuesday of each month both in person and through Zoom.
We want this to be a safe harbor Leslie who recently accepted a position with Drug Free Tipton said. I want them to know their children matter their children were beautiful souls caught up in something bigger than them and it didnt define them.
Last week alone the Shelby County Health Department reported roughly 53 drug overdoses. The most common ages were between 30 and 40.

MEMPHIS Tenn.  There are many resources for people struggling with drug addiction. There are also actions to combat drug activity. Still we are seeing an increase in drug overdoses in Shelby County which is higher than last year.
One hit is can truly be the last said Christopher Moore the Cocaine and Alcohol Awareness Program CAAP's State Opioid Response program coordinator.
It is troubling and real. Since January 1 2023 Shelby County Health Department suspected 398 drug-related overdoses. Of that 73 resulted in death.
I'm a person with lived experience of substance abuse problems. Back in 2006 I enter treatment said Moore. He now works for CAAP.
We are community-based treatment providers. Our goal one of the most important goals of our program currently is to connect with the indigent and uninsured who are struggling with opiate use disorder said Moore.
One of the biggest issues they have seen is with fentanyl.
We're encountering an increased trend of individuals who are under the impression that they're using one substance only to find out that it has been tainted with fentanyl. It's very common nowadays for someone perhaps who's using methamphetamine to fail a drug test and truly express shock related to the fact that fentanyl is in their system said Moore.
He is referring to accidental overdoses.
Now you're seeing just an increased prevalence of other illicit drugs on the streetsyou know having fentanyl in them which really creates some additional threats to those who maybe aren't really aware that what they're using really poses an intimate threat to their life in that moment said Moore. Fentanyl is dangerous in and of itself.

Two Fayette County Tennessee high school students are dead and another is in the hospital in critical condition after a possible drug overdose just hours before a graduation ceremony at Fayette Ware high school Tuesday.
The Fayette County Sheriff's Office said they are investigating the incident as a drug overdose and the Fayette County Public School System confirmed all three involved were young women one 16 and two 17 that were completing their junior year.
One of the victims was identified as 16-year-old Alyssa Thorne by her father Mark Thorne.
Its a real shame you know that this little community has gotten a little touch of whats all over the country Somerville resident Dennis said. Its just a matter of what kids are into today.
Its just one of those sad things that we hear about but its hitting so close to home these days Somerville mother and resident Angie Powers said. Its so final you just wonder and ask the questions why and what do we need to do to reverse these effects.
According to the latest data shared by the Tennessee Department of Health were 21 overdose deaths in 2021 in those younger than 18. Its the highest since 2017.
Dianne Sherrod the Southwest Tennessee overdose prevention specialist said it's a trend that is worsening in the age of social media and more potent drugs.
Today in the culture that were in we dont have time to reach a bottom. The substances that are on our streets today theyre killing people on the first use Sherrod said. Because our children are so vulnerable particularly with their social media platforms. Theres people that have access to them through these social media platforms.
Sherrod and those with Hope Restored Counseling say its important for those with loved ones that may battle an addiction to pay attention to key physical symptoms.
Just the change in the size of like your pupil and then just the spell of your body or odor from your breathe that you might notice Ryan Massie from Hope Restored Counseling said.
Drug addiction counselors also say there are emotional symptoms.
Mood swings or just change in the normal attitude Massie said. They can be more angry than usual or more irritable than usual.

Original article published on Jan. 3 2023
The death of a pioneering rapper from the south who blazed trails for other women emcees who came after her has prompted a number of questions namely how did she die
The question was answered on Thursday when the autopsy report for her death revealed Lola Chantrelle Gangsta Boo Mitchell died on New Years Day following the consumption of a toxic blend of cocaine fentanyl and alcohol Bossip reported.
Gangsta Boo who rose to prominence as part of the Memphis-based Three 6 Mafia rap collective was found dead at a home in Memphis just hours after celebrating the end of 2022 with her family at a concert. She had been showing no signs of distress in the hours before her death according to reports. She was 43 years old.
The official cause of death for Gangsta Boo was not immediately announced sparking rampant speculation in the interim about how she lost her life since the Memphis Police Department has said there were no obvious signs of foul play according to local news outlet Fox 13.
TMZ previously cited anonymous sources in reporting that Gangsta Boo may have died from a drug overdose by way of fentanyl.
From TMZ back on New years Day
Sources connected to Gangsta Boo tell TMZ  the rappers death appears to be drug-related. Were told Gangsta was with her brother last night at a local concert in Memphis and that her sibling started to overdose sometime in the night  requiring hospitalization.
While he ended up being okay our sources tell us that people familiar with Gangsta Boos death scene insist narcotics were found on her person and that a fentanyl-laced substance is believed to be at play. Were told the police are launching an official investigation.
By all indications Gangsta Boo was still very much enjoying her career. The Memphis Commerical Appeal reported that she filmed a music video just last week.
Gangsta Boo also appeared on the popular and controversial Drink Champs podcast talking about her legacy in Memphis hip-hop and the women rappers she inspired.
NewsOne sends heartfelt condolences to Gangsta Boos family and friends for their loss.
What is fentanyl
Fentanyl-laced cocaine deaths are on the rise in America. Drug dealers are now selling cocaine that is laced with fentanyl one of the most deadly drugs on the streets and its killing people. Comic Fuquan Johnson and actor Michael K. Williams both died in 2021 from overdoses after ingesting cocaine laced with fentanyl.
The highly addictive synthetic opioid is prescribed by doctors to rid breakthrough pain from medical procedures or cancer patients. The Schedule II drug can also be used as a part of anesthesia to help reduce pain after surgery. Overdosing on the drug can cause respiratory failure a coma permanent brain damage andor death. Its potency is estimated to be 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine and 50 times more potent than heroin. Because the opioid is so strong a small amount could cause an overdose.
Fentanyl is also highly addictive and cheap to produce which makes it an enticing option for drug dealers looking to stretch their product. It is frequently sold on the black market as powder small candies eye droppers nasal sprays or in pill form made to mimic other prescription opioids. Its also commonly mixed with heroin methamphetamine and MDMA.

Aisling Mäki
Aisling Mäki has spent the better part of two decades writing about Memphis. A former digital journalist for WMC Action News 5 and staff reporter for Memphis Daily News her work has also appeared in The Commercial Appeal High Ground News I Love Memphis Inside Memphis Business The Memphis Flyer Memphis Parent Memphis Magazine and Tri-State Defender.
In addition to the morning cleanup crew Maddox said the school police officer and another staff member patrol Elkins grounds during recess. But she acknowledged that the school could use more resources to keep the block clean and safe. The campus is only partially gated she noted and most of the fencing is only a few feet high.
The conditions in the neighborhood are causing some families to move away contributing to a decline in enrollment at Elkin. Overall enrollment there is down by nearly 100 this year Maddox said. Some of those students transferred to charter schools.
Maddox couldnt say how much of the decline was due to concerns about safety and quality of life in the area but she said she had spoken with a number of families who were moving away for those reasons.
Its not about the school she said. Its about whats happening in the neighborhood.
When classes let out for the day students are again surrounded by the fallout of addiction. Once they get home some are under orders from their parents to remain indoors. Others like Christia Leiva a fourth grader at Elkin are afraid to go outside.
I tell him to go out to play on the street with the other kids and he says No too much drugs Mom said Maria Cardona Christias mother speaking in Spanish. I dont like it here he says. Lets leave. Thats a theme with him Vámanos.
He also asks questions shes not always sure how to answer.
Sometimes Cardona said when he sees people injecting themselves he says Mom what is that theyre putting in themselves
Elkin teachers such as Chelsea Trainor work to address childrens fears about the violence and drug use they witness outside. Each classroom begins the day with a morning meeting where the teacher invites students to share anything thats bothering them.
Theyre kind of focused on that in their minds Trainor said. So when it comes time to read its hard for them to look at the words on the page and read because theyre more worried about what happened at home last night what happened outside their house what happened on the way to school that morning.
The meetings also help her learn about serious problems at home she can refer to a school social worker.
A middle school serving children from Kensington uses a similar approach with older students whose understanding of the trauma they experience is growing.
On a recent afternoon at Memphis Street Academy a charter school for grades five through eight a dozen students sat in a circle. School counselor Zita Collins led them in a discussion.
Can I hear a yea from anyone whos been impacted by drugs in this community Collins asked.
A staggered chorus of voices chimed in.
Everyones a yea Collins noted.
Daily classroom talks like this are part of a learning effort that supports social and emotional development. The idea is to provide a space where students can share whats weighing on their minds.
Eighth-grader Benjamin Holt talked about a man who overdosed across the street from his home. He watched as paramedics loaded the dead mans body onto a stretcher.
Its hard to explain the way they just picked him up and threw him on Benjamin said. Personally I dont want to see that ever again.
That would be hard for even any adult to see Collins said.
Seeing something and saying something about it
Collins listened sympathetically as students described other experiences family members dying of overdoses screams outside at night that made it impossible to sleep drug dealers soliciting them on the street and accidentally stumbling into someone who was injecting drugs in public.
Traumatic experiences like these can lead to behavior problems and depression in students school counselors said.
At the root of all of that is not knowing how to cope with emotions and having to deal with pretty big emotions at a pretty young age said Brittany Buchanan a fifth-grade counselor at Memphis Street Academy.
Buchanan said she spends a lot of her time teaching students how to communicate feelings and techniques like deep breathing and yoga to calm them down.
During the classroom discussion school CEO Naimah Holliday-Wimberly encouraged students to join a sports team or a club to extend their stay at school each day. The library would also stay open until 530 p.m. to give them a quiet place to get help with their homework she said.
We want this place to be a safe haven for you a place where you can come and just escape all the worries of the world all the worries of Kensington all the worries of your neighborhood Holliday-Wimberly said.
Memphis Street Academy and Elkin Elementary School are among a couple dozen schools in Kensington grappling with the impact of the opioid crisis. The School District of Philadelphia created a task force last year that meets weekly to support 18 of the most-affected schools.
Currently the district is working with the city to put taller fencing around Elkin School. Neither the school district nor the city could say when the extended 8-foot fence would be installed.
The Managing Directors Office is in the process of procuring a temporary structure in the interim said city spokeswoman Deana Gamble.
Maddox the principal said Elkin would welcome all the extra help and resources it could get to beat back the collateral effects of opioid addiction that wash onto school property like a tide each morning.
Its not over she said of the neighborhoods drug crisis. I want to make that clear to everyone that its not over.

As the Shelby County chief medical examiner Dr. Karen Chancellor has a close-up view of the increasing number of lives ended by drug overdoses.
Every day I come to work there is an overdose death suspected overdose death or multiple ones she told the audience at the Tennessee Opioid Epidemic Forum Tuesday night.
In 2010 there were 11 heroin overdose deaths in Shelby County. By 2016 the number had jumped to 90 Chancellor said.
And 114 people died in 2016 of overdoses from another opioid drug fentanyl she said. The two numbers overlap - some people were using both heroin and fentanyl.
The Commercial Appeal hosted the forum at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. The other sponsors of the event were BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee Health Foundation as well as the university.
The event drew about 80 people many of whom cited a personal connection to the issue and expressed strong emotions in the question-and-answer session. One woman said she knows someone who's looking for treatment but has no insurance. One man said he and his wife had their son arrested - he went through Drug Court and survived. Another man said his son overdosed and died.
Participants engaged in a spirited discussion on topics such as drug legalization - Col. Paul Wright commander of the Memphis police Organized Crime Unit says that's a political question and his job is to enforce the law.
Wright also said Memphis police have created a 10-person unit that investigates heroin deaths and treats them as homicides. That statement drew a critical question from an audience member who said the policy would discourage people from reporting dangerous overdoses.
Wright said final judgment on the cases is up to the courts. The courts have to look at your mental state at the time. We look at finding the facts to solve this persons death.
He also said arrests won't solve the problem. We cant lock our problem up. I think the fix is getting some help. Getting assistance for these individuals. In response to a question about stopping drugs from Mexico he said that's hard to do. If you demand something theyre gonna give it to you. The key is to cut American demand he said.
After the forum he said the Organized Crime Unit gives 250000 per year to support drug treatment via the Drug Court.
And audience members and participants traded information about drug treatment. UT experts Dr. David Stern and Dr. Daniel D. Sumrok spoke about the university's center dedicated to addiction medicine and pointed toward an underlying psychological cause of addiction trauma from abuse and other adverse childhood experiences.
Panelist Mekel S. Harris a psychologist with Christ Community Health Services said many people in our society have a hard time dealing with pain either physical or emotional. She said people shouldn't automatically use drugs to avoid pain. Pain is a signal that you are alive.
Preliminary data suggest nationwide deaths by drug overdoses rose 19 percent between 2015 and 2016 and probably exceeded 59000 last year according to an analysis by the New York Times. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death among Americans under 50 the newspaper reported.
In the award-winning 2015 book Dreamland author Sam Quinones described the development of the phenomenon drug companies pushed addictive painkillers to the general public and doctors over-prescribed the drugs. This created addicts. Then drug dealers from one area in Mexicos Nayarit state developed a business model that involved home delivery of heroin to mostly white addicts he wrote.
The model spread throughout the country.
Other factors have emerged more recently including drug dealers selling fake opioids and heroin made of a substitute drug fentanyl. A drug related to fentanyl carfentanil is 5000 times more powerful than heroin and can easily cause a deadly overdose the New York Times reported.
Kennard Brown executive vice chancellor and chief operations officer at UTHSC said the opioid forum may become an annual event since the issue apparently isn't going away.

Jeff Sessions could have saved the end of his drug speech for the beginning. And he could have saved it for a speech in Nashville. Or Knoxville. Or Chattanooga.
But then again when youre trying to drum up support for harsh largely ineffective penalties for drug crimes a mostly-black city like Memphis is a convenient stage for playing to fears.
The attorney general singled out Memphis violent crime rate in a speech earlier this month  one in which he announced that he was in effect reinstating the mandatory minimum sentencing policies that the Justice Department had halted under the Obama administration.
Then yesterday Sessions visited Memphis to double-down on that talk about how horrible the violence was here how bad the drugs were here and how his people werent going to put up with it.
On the violence hes right.
Last year 228 people were killed in Memphis  195 of which were classified as murders. That rate mirrors the violence that wracked the city in the 1990s.
Ironically that violence happened during the height of the crack cocaine epidemic and during a time when mandatory minimum sentences  the approach that Sessions wants to revive  were ramped up to deal with the problem.
They didnt work then  and they wont work now.
All those harsh sentences did was create an environment where one in nine black children now have a parent in prison and where a prior record for having the tiniest amounts of drugs shuts off virtually all chances of getting a job or a place to live.
That predicament is a huge part of whats driving the poverty and despair behind the violence in Memphis and its something that Sessions policies would exacerbate.
Yet if Sessions aim was to put a fright in people about dying from drugs or crimes related to drugs he could have done that on the other side of Tennessee  because in Nashville 367 people died in 2015 from opioid overdoses. In Chattanooga 183 people died from such overdoses while in Knoxville those deaths stood at 325.
All combined the drug deaths in those predominantly-white cities totaled 875. Those are the places that have for the most part helped to make Tennessee the state with the second highest rate of opioid abuse in the nation  next to Sessions home state of Alabama.
He talked about that problem  toward the end.
There is no doubt in my mind thatthe surge of heroin and opioid abuse will bring with it a surge in crime Sessions said. I was in New Hampshirethere were 50 mothers on the stage who had lost kids to opioid abuse.
But said local activist Tami Sawyer who protested Sessions visit along with hundreds of others his mention of the opioid issue was a sop to white people who believe he will treat their problem more as a sickness than as a crime.
To me its a buzzword because they know that their children will be cared for but for us hes talking about putting more cops on the streets to arrest people for having marijuana Sawyer said. But whats killing people is heroinwhats killing people are opioids
Hes Sessions not going to Nashville to raise money and our leaders here theyre running on fear.
Shes right.
By continuing to single out Memphis for its drug-related violence to justify ramping up a drug war that made it worse as opposed to going to Nashville or Knoxville or Chattanooga to hammer them about their opioid and heroin problems Sessions does more to play to fears about black criminality than to ideas about how to fix the problem.
And while its sad that Sessions is using Memphians suffering as a platform to revive draconian approaches to drugs and violence crime it will be even sadder if officials remain silent as he does so.

MEMPHIS  The University of Tennessee College of Medicines Center for Addiction Science was recognized today as the first Center of Excellence In Addiction Medicine by The Addiction Medicine Foundation.
The Center for Addiction Science was founded to address the untreated addiction epidemic not only in Memphis but across the country. The center provides clinical treatment services including cognitive behavioral therapy medication-assisted treatment motivational enhancement therapy and 12-step program facilitation across all demographics. The center is also training physicians to offer alternate forms of pain therapy to avoid over-prescription of opioids.
As a medical school dedicated to serving the Memphis community it is our belief that we must make a difference and be an essential part of the health care fabric of our city said David Stern MD Robert Kaplan Executive Dean of the College of Medicine and vice chancellor for Clinical Affairs at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. We recognized the unmet addiction need and we are working to address it head on both in our region and nationwide.
The Center of Excellence designation from the Addiction Medicine Foundation a national organization that accredits physician training in addiction medicine puts the center at the forefront of its field  as the first in the country to bring together clinical care research education and community outreach to address addiction and deadly substance use.
The UT College of Medicine has emerged as the nations first integrated addiction model said Kevin Kunz MD MPH executive vice president of The Addiction Medicine Foundation. There are locations and fellowships where all the elements exist yet not in a unified fashion and not interactive. These components even when they all exist at one institution are often silos of excellence. UT College of Medicines Center for Addiction Science offers all the necessary elements for success and will serve as a model for future centers across the country.
The combination of the harmful effects of addiction including alcohol and nicotine use represent the leading cause of death in Tennessee. More than 1263 Tennesseans died from opioid overdose in 2014 according to the most recent figures from the Tennessee Department of Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Substance abuse places an extraordinary burden on medical social and financial sectors in Tennessee Dr. Stern said. We have evidence-based treatment interventions that help improve and save lives. The Center for Addiction Science makes those services available to anyone.
Leveraging the strengths of an academic medical center a new addiction medicine fellowship through the Center for Addiction Science trains physicians and health care professionals in evidence-based protocols to better recognize diagnose treat and prevent addiction. Multidisciplinary research is also underway with particular focus on neonatal abstinence syndrome which affects newborns exposed to addictive drugs in the womb.
Addiction is an equal-opportunity illness said Daniel Sumrok MD director of the Center for Addiction Science. It does not discriminate. The picture of addiction is much different now than it was even a decade ago. Anyone can become addicted to painkillers and we are doing our part to reduce that dependency rate.
The UT Center for Addiction Science managed by University Clinical Health is located at 1325 Eastmoreland Avenue Suite 440 and the main phone number is 901-866-8630.

MEMPHIS Tenn.  A Dyersburg Tennessee nurse has pleaded guilty to health care fraud and unlawfully distributing controlled substances.
The U.S. Department of Justice DOJ said Kelly McCallum 41 was an advance practice registered nurse who operated the Convenient Care Clinic. The DOJ said she held a registration from the DEA allowing her to prescribe drugs. The DOJ said McCallum was aware of a patient who died after overdosing on drugs she prescribed yet continued to prescribe controlled substances that were not for legitimate medical reasons.
The DOJ said McCallum also billed Medicare and Medicaid for services she did not provide totaling more than 16000.
Investigators also said McCallum while acting as their medical provider McCallum had sexual relationships with two patients from January 2012 to early 2021.
McCallum pleaded guilty to two counts of unlawful distribution of controlled substances and one count of healthcare fraud according to the DOJ. She is set to be scheduled on Oct. 3 where she faces a maximum of 20 years in prison on each drug count and 10 years in prison for the fraud.

What is becoming a more common occurrence police say is the presence of fentanyl one of the deadliest opiates on the market.
Fentanyl is so deadly Wright said that in powder form the equivalent of two grains of salt added to opioids is a guaranteed overdose.

We now know what led to the tragic passing of Gangsta Boo.
Spotted on TMZ Gangsta Boo died after ingesting a deadly cocktail of hard drugs and alcohol the celebrity gossip site reports.
Local Memphis news affiliate FOX13 says the Hip-Hop star was pronounced dead on the scene after overdosing on fentanyl cocaine and alcohol.
Gangsta Boo real name Lola Mitchell was found unconscious on New Years Day inside a Memphis residence and could not be resuscitated despite attempts to save the 43-year-old rappers life.
She quickly became a popular artist in the 90s especially after songs like Where Dem Dollas At. Gangsta Boo was also a member of Three 6 Mafia later joining the iconic Hip-Hop stable founded by DJ Paul Juicy J and Lord Infamous. Boo was later brought in along with Crunchy Black and Koopsta Knicca appearing on the groups classic albums.
Gangsta Boo was only limited to working with Three 6 Mafia. She also collaborated with other southern Hip-Hop juggernauts Gucci Mane Lil Jon OutKast E-40 T.I. west coast rapper The Game and more.
Fentanyls Dangerous Hold On The Hip-Hop Community
Gangsta Boo joins an alarming trend of fentanyl-related deaths in the Black and Hip-Hop community. Master Ps daughter Michael K. Williams comedian Fuquan Johnson Coolio Mac Miller and many more all have died and fentanyl was involved in some shape or form.
The Biden-Harris administration is actively working to stop the dangerous flow of opioids and fentanyl in the country.
Per The White House website
President Biden has made combatting the opioid crisis a key part of his Unity Agenda for America and has taken several actions to reduce both the supply of fentanyl and negative health outcomes associated with illicit fentanyl and other illicit substances. Fentanyl was dangerous before and it is even more dangerous now due to its combination with xylazine. Addressing the fentanyl crisis also requires addressing the drugsin particular xylazinewith which fentanyl is being combined. Saving lives is the Administrations North Star and drives the Presidents drug policy.
Something needs to be done quickly before we lose more lives.

Back in October a 60-something-year-old man named Ronald Hiers and his wife Carla were recorded passed out on the sidewalk in Memphis together after overdosing on heroin.
Fortunately for the couple they didn't die as a result of the overdose.
However the graphic video did circulate around the web after a man named Courtland Garner live-streamed their overdose on Facebook for the entire world to see. The video garnered over 3 million views.
Facebook
The footage shows Ronald and Carla passed on a Memphis sidewalk as a group of people form around them to witness the bizarre sight. If you haven't seen the video yet you can watch it here.
While most of the spectators laughed and joked at the couple one person did attempt to check their pulses to see if they had died.
Facebook
Luckily the couple was revived by first responders using Narcan a drug used to reverse the effects of opioid overdoses.
Two months after the graphic video went viral Ronald Hiers is speaking out during a new interview with CNN.
These days things have turned around for the Hiers. According to the report the couple was granted scholarships by the addiction treatment organization Turning Point. With the scholarships both Ronald and Carla have been able to seek help for their drug addictions.
YouTube
After watching the viral Facebook video of people laughing at the couple Ronald spoke to CNN saying
I am a son. A husband. A brother. A grandfather. A father. I'm a human being. That's what so many people missed about it. Those were two human beings.
While it might seem like a brilliant idea to instantly whip your phone out and record someone at their lowest point purely for your own benefit it isn't a brilliant idea.
I think we can all agree that someone's life is far more valuable than the amount of likes you'd get on your social media post.
However to be fair the 9-minute video might have helped save the Hiers' lives.
The report states that Ronald was able to successfully finish his treatment at a rehabilitation center located in Southaven Mississippi while Carla remains in treatment at a separate facility in Massachusetts.
Here's Ronald Hiers' full interview with CNN.
The man responsible for filming the video Courtland Garner would not speak to CNN. He did respond to a few social media posts which further explain his stance on the situation. He said
They were doing children things. It was a spectacle. It made me laugh.
Garner responded to another comment saying
I don't deal with people on drugs like that. I don't know what they're capable of. I know kids be on social media.
While you might expect these nonchalant responses to upset recovering addict Ronald Hiers he said he isn't mad at the kids who seemingly made a joke out of him and his wife hitting rock bottom
He did not put myself nor my wife in that position. We put ourselves there. Had it been his mother or father on that sidewalk on their face he would have certainly called 911 instead of filming a video to see how many hits he could get on it.
Sure Garner didn't do anything wrong. Hiers is right -- the couple put themselves in that position.
Hopefully Garner is able to come up with a better action plan for helping those in need if he were to come across a similar situation. You never know the same thing could easily happen to you or someone you know.

MEMPHIS Tenn.  People are losing their lives so the work we do day in and day out is helping people achieve recovery Angela Quadrani with Vertava Health said.
Quadrani is with the Mid-South addiction treatment center and weighed in Monday about a string of possibly linked and potential drug overdose deaths - nearly a dozen - within the past week in Memphis.
It's incredibly tragic and our hearts go out to anyone whose lost a loved one to an overdose Quadrani said.
Memphis Police said one possible overdose happened this past Thursday afternoon when officers found a 45-year old woman dead in an apartment in Midtown Memphis.
Several friends of that woman didn't want to give her name out of respect for her family but told Local 24 News they suspected dangerously laced drugs were to blame.
A loft of the illicit drugs or drugs on the street are pressed with substances such as fentanyl carfentanil that are leading to unintentional or unintended overdoses Quadrani said.
The concerns continue to linger during the COVID-19 crisis.
Those experiencing addiction and their loved ones may be struggling to navigate through all the change. Help is available. Any timeday or night. Call the Tennessee REDLINE at 800-889-9789. httpst.comliw76Afrq  TN Dept. of Health TNDeptofHealth August 31 2020
In mid-May the Shelby County Health Department reported an unprecedented surge of more than 100 drug overdose deaths in the first 60 days of the pandemic.
Any pill that's been mixed in with that quote unquote bad batch could potentially affect hundreds Quadrani said.
In response since the spring the Shelby County Health Department set up street level outreach and provided the opioid emergency medication Narcan.
Quadrani said constant communication is especially important if your loved one or friend is struggling.
If you know your loved one is prone to substance use of abuse or maybe has a history with drug or alcohol addiction reach out check in see how they are doing Quadrani said.
Opioids including prescription painkillers and heroin are now the leading cause of unintentional death in the United States.

The University of Tennessee College of Medicines Center for Addiction Science was recognized today as the first Center of Excellence In Addiction Medicine by The Addiction Medicine Foundation.
The Center for Addiction Science was founded to address the untreated addiction epidemic not only in Memphis but across the country. The center provides clinical treatment services including cognitive behavioral therapy medication-assisted treatment motivational enhancement therapy and 12-step program facilitation across all demographics. The center is also training physicians to offer alternate forms of pain therapy to avoid over-prescription of opioids.
As a medical school dedicated to serving the Memphis community it is our belief that we must make a difference and be an essential part of the health care fabric of our city said David Stern MD Robert Kaplan Executive Dean of the College of Medicine and vice chancellor for Clinical Affairs at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center UTHSC. We recognized the unmet addiction need and we are working to address it head on both in our region and nationwide.
The Center of Excellence designation from The Addiction Medicine Foundation a national organization that accredits physician training in addiction medicine puts the center at the forefront of its field  as the first in the country to bring together clinical care research education and community outreach to address addiction and deadly substance use.
The UT College of Medicine has emerged as the nations first integrated addiction model said Kevin Kunz MD MPH executive vice president of The Addiction Medicine Foundation. There are locations and fellowships where all the elements exist yet not in a unified fashion and not interactive. These components even when they all exist at one institution are often silos of excellence. UT College of Medicines Center for Addiction Science offers all the necessary elements for success and will serve as a model for future centers across the country.
The combination of the harmful effects of addiction including alcohol and nicotine use represent the leading cause of death in Tennessee. More than 1263 Tennesseans died from opioid overdose in 2014 according to the most recent figures from the Tennessee Department of Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Substance abuse places an extraordinary burden on medical social and financial sectors in Tennessee Dr. Stern said. We have evidence-based treatment interventions that help improve and save lives. The Center for Addiction Science makes those services available to anyone.
Addiction is an equal-opportunity illness said Daniel Sumrok MD director of the Center for Addiction Science at UTHSC. It does not discriminate. The picture of addiction is much different now than it was even a decade ago. Anyone can become addicted to painkillers and we are doing our part to reduce that dependency rate.
Leveraging the strengths of an academic medical center a new addiction medicine fellowship through the Center for Addiction Science trains physicians and health care professionals in evidence-based protocols to better recognize diagnose treat and prevent addiction. Multidisciplinary research is also underway with particular focus on neonatal abstinence syndrome which affects newborns exposed to addictive drugs in the womb.
This recognition is a great credit to our team and our corporate partners Dr. Sumrok said. We are committed to growing the fully-integrated model we have defined.
The UT Center for Addiction Science managed by University Clinical Health universityclinicalhealth.com is located at 1325 Eastmoreland Avenue Suite 440 and the main phone number is 901 866-8630.

The Local I-Team investigates the growing heroin problem in Shelby County.
As of this week 21 people have died of heroin overdoses in Shelby County since the beginning of the year.
Police are calling it an epidemic.
The problem is so bad Memphis police have changed how officers handle overdoses. In an effort to track heroin sellers the Organized Crime Unit now takes over all investigations involving heroin overdose deaths. Families of those who have died want dealers off the streets so more lives wont be lost.
Two local families are now suffering after both 19-year-old Brennan Rucker and 22-year-old Crystal Gabriesheski died of whats believed to be heroin overdoses. Rucker passed away in December Gabriesheski last month. The two were good friends.
I feel angry hurt said Cassie Milam Gabriesheskis aunt.
I do not wish this pain on any person said Ruckers mother Kristen Mitchell. Its unfortunate because these are good kids that made bad decisions.
Both grew up in Memphis suburbs came from good families and died within two months of each other. Neither family knew about the heroin.
I wish so much now I would have been aware and able to be there for her said Milam.
In both cases the families say if the people the teens were with had called 911 for help sooner they may have survived.
Ruckers mom says her sons friends waited an hour while he was overdosing before dumping him at an emergency room and driving off.
They did not call 911. Instead they decided to freak out and panic said Mitchell.
Gabriesheskis family says her friends didnt call 911 until they put her in a car and drove her away from the drug dealers home.
We were told if they would have just called 911 she could have been saved said Milam.
According to Memphis police last year 27 people died of heroin overdoses. So far in 2016 21 people have already died which is why Memphis police now handle the deaths as investigations. Many of the victims are in their late teens or early twenties.
Talk to your kids. Be involved. Ask questions. Annoy them. Its your job as a parent. Find out what is going on with them said Mitchell.
In Ruckers case his mother finds some comfort knowing her sons heart still beats in Memphis.
Brennan actually signed up to be an organ donor and was able to save six lives as a result said Mitchell.
Gabriesheskis family wants justice and has a message to those who were there that fatal night.
Please talk to the police. Please let them know. Im and asking and begging you so myself and my family can be at peace and rest said Milam.

MEMPHIS TN WMC - A Memphis man caught on video and ridiculed by witnesses during a heroin overdose sought help and is now speaking out about his recovery.
After 40 years of drug and alcohol addiction Ron Hiers is now drug free and opening up about the low moment that made him decide to get help.
Heirs 61 said he was in a Walgreens bathroom with his wife shooting up heroin just before they passed out on a sidewalk. A passerby went live on Facebook showing the scene where people laughed and took pictures of the couple who was obviously in desperate need of help.
The last thing I remember was walking out of Walgreens Hiers said. The public humiliation that my family had suffered mine being broadcast throughout the country and the world.
Hiers credits the man who published that video for saving his life. His daughter who lives out of state saw the video and quickly got her father enrolled at Turning Point treatment center.
He was in pretty bad shape Brian Sullivan Turning Point said. Our medical team took him straight in worked on him and kept a close eye on his vitals.
Hiers was in treatment for nearly two months. Now he is clean and taking life one day at a time.
It'll be a lifetime battle for me but it gets easier he said. It's like grieving for a loved one that's passed.
Hiers wife is also being treated but she is hundreds of miles away on the east coast.
There are places you can go and get help. And if you don't you might not see Christmas he said to anyone who is battling addiction.
Ron Hiers' lifetime of addiction reached a turning point and now looks ahead with hope of a new beginning.
If you or someone you love needs help breaking an addiction please call 1-888-614-2251. You can also visit Turning Point for more information.

Drug overdoses represent a public health crisis in Shelby County. More Shelby County residents die of overdose each year than die in auto accidents. The Shelby County Health Department conducts public health surveillance on suspected drug overdoses in Shelby County provides free harm reduction tools including naloxone to reverse overdoses and fentanyl test strips and links people living with substance use disorders to care in collaboration with community partners. The ultimate goal of the Shelby County Health Department Overdose Prevention project is to reduce fatal and non-fatal drug overdoses in our county.
Overdose Surveillance
Shelby County Health Departments Bureau of Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases receives preliminary information from the West Tennessee Regional Forensic Center WTRFC about suspected overdose deaths. The Bureau of Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases also compiles reports of non-fatal suspected overdoses from several data sources. This data is provisional and subject to change but provides a snapshot of overdose activity in our county to inform targeted intervention efforts in collaboration with community partners.
Provisional Opioid Data and Reports
Harm Reduction
Harm reduction is a set of strategies aimed at reducing the negative health consequences associated with drug use including overdose. Anyone who uses drugs runs the risk of overdose. Effective public health strategies act to reduce the risk of overdose and other harm to the individual while providing linkage to treatment and other health care resources.
Naloxone
Naloxone is a medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration FDA designed to rapidly reverse opioid overdose. It is an opioid antagonistmeaning that it binds to opioid receptors and can reverse and block the effects of other opioids such as heroin morphine and oxycodone. Administered when a patient is showing signs of opioid overdose naloxone can save lives.
Naloxone comes in two FDA-approved forms
Injectable  usually injected with a needle into muscle but can be injected into a vein or under the skin.
Prepackaged Nasal Spray  an FDA-approved prefilled needle-free device that requires no assembly and is sprayed into one nostril while the person lies on their back.
Nasal spray naloxone is easy to use and medical training is not required. Please watch this video that shows how to use the naloxone nasal spray.
Opioid overdose is life-threatening and requires immediate emergency attention. Always call 911 after administering naloxone.
Naloxone is not a cure for opioid addiction and it does not prevent future overdoses.
Naloxone wont harm someone if there are not overdosing on opioids or other drugs so its always best to use it if you think someone is overdosing.
Naloxone is effective if opioids are misused in combination with other sedatives or stimulants. It is not effective in treating overdoses of benzodiazepines or stimulant overdoses involving cocaine and amphetamines.
More information about naloxone from the Tennessee Department of Health in English and Spanish.
Fentanyl Test Strips
The risk of accidental overdose is greater than ever because of synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Fentanyl is up to 100 times more potent than heroin and is the most common drug involved in overdose deaths. Just 3 milligrams of fentanyl can kill an adult.
Powdered fentanyl looks identical to heroin. It is commonly mixed with other drugs including heroin cocaine and methamphetamine Fentanyl is also sometimes pressed into pills made to look like popular prescription drugs like Xanax and oxycodone. The counterfeit pills are almost indistinguishable from the real prescription drugs but may contain a deadly quantity of fentanyl. That is why Shelby County Health Department and its partnering agencies provide fentanyl test strips.
Fentanyl test strips are a low-cost method of helping prevent drug overdoses and reducing harm. They are small strips of paper that can detect the presence of fentanyl in other drugs cocaine methamphetamine heroin etc. and drug forms. Fentanyl test strips provide people who use drugs and communities with important information about fentanyl in the illicit drug supply so they can take steps to reduce risk of overdose.
Link to more information about fentanyl and fentanyl test strips.
Harm Reduction Kits
Shelby County Health Department provides free harm reduction kits that contain two doses of naloxone and 10 fentanyl test strips along with instructions for using them. Free harm reduction kits may be picked up at the following locations

LIFE EXPECTANCY
Life expectancy is an estimate of the average age that a person is expected to live. It is a key indicator of population health. High life expectancy rates can be attributed to improved living conditions better health care and decreased childhoodearlymid to late life mortality. Increased life expectancy can lead residents to focus more on planning for retirement and healthcare. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services states that in the U.S. healthcare spending doubles after a person reaches their 65th birthday and by the time they reach 85 the cost has more than doubled again.10
The life expectancy in Shelby County was 76.3 1 in 2020 almost three years less than in the United States overall where the life expectancy was 78.82 3 . In Shelby County life expectancy was declining slowly from 75.9 in 2012 to 75.2 in 2019 but fell sharply in 2020 to 72.3.
Spotlights on Health Monkeypox Outbreak 2022 In May 2022 cases of monkeypox began to be reported in countries where the disease is not endemic. As of August 22 2022 there were 41664 laboratory confirmed cases reported in 96 locations that have not historically reported monkeypox. In the United States as of August 31st 2022 there was a total of 19591 1 monkeypox cases of which 212 were in Tennessee. There have been 36 laboratory-confirmed and probable cases identified in Shelby County as of August 31st 2022.27 In Shelby County monkeypox is seen primarily in African American males and those who identify as gay or bisexual many of whom are HIV positive. Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by the monkeypox virus. The monkeypox virus is part of the same family of viruses as the variola virus which causes smallpox. Monkeypox symptoms are similar to smallpox symptoms but milder and monkeypox is rarely fatal. Monkeypox was discovered in 1958 when two outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in colonies of monkeys kept for research. Despite being named monkeypox the source of the disease remains unknown. However African rodents and non-human primates like monkeys might harbor the virus and infect people. Monkeypox is endemic to several countries in Africa. 26 People infected with monkeypox will develop a rash that can look like pimples or blisters that could be painful or itchy. This rash can spread to all body parts including palms of hands and soles of feet. Other symptoms might include fever chills swollen lymph nodes exhaustion body aches cough and nasal congestion. Symptoms usually start within three weeks of exposure to the virus. Flu-like symptoms will usually develop 1-4 days before the rash. Monkeypox can be spread from when symptoms start until the rash has healed all scabs have fallen off and a fresh layer of skin has formed. The illness typically lasts 2-4 weeks. 26 Monkeypox can spread through direct contact with an infected persons rash scab or body fluid. It can also be spread through touching objects fabrics clothing bedding or towels and surfaces used by someone with monkeypox. Intimate or sexual contact including hugging massage kissing prolonged face-to-face contacts and sharing of fetish gear and sex toys has been found to be one of the primary ways that monkeypox is being spread in this outbreak. Currently testing is only recommended if you have a rash consistent with monkeypox and people tested should isolate at home and away from others until results are known.26 Some ways to help prevent monkeypox infection include avoiding close skin-to-skin contact with people who have a rash that looks like monkeypox avoid contact with objects and materials that a person with monkeypox has used and wash your hands often soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. COVID-19 COVID-19 coronavirus disease 2019 is a viral disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus which was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan China. It is highly contagious and has spread rapidly around the globe. The word corona means crown and refers to the structural appearance of the spike proteins that stick out from the virus. The virus uses the spike protein to attach to human cells to infect them. Scientific communities study mutations leading to changes in the virus particularly those that result in changes to the spike protein which plays a crucial role in the infectivity of the virus. Variants of the virus arise when mutations occur that significantly change how quickly the virus spreads the severity of illness caused or the effectiveness of treatments.4445 COVID-19 virus can quickly spread through respiratory droplets and frequently causes upper and lower respiratory infections that feel like a cold flu or pneumonia. Additionally other body parts may be infected by COVID-19 resulting in a wide variety of symptoms and outcomes related to the virus. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or may even be asymptomatic but some have a severe infection and some may suffer from post-COVID-19 conditions long COVID even if they have mild or no symptoms. Older adults and people with co-morbidities or underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of severe COVID-19. Some risk factors that may be associated with severe disease include but are not limited to older age obesity smoking or substance abuse low physical activity asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD cardiovascular disease cerebrovascular disease cancer immunocompromising conditions etc. The best protection against COVID-19 disease is vaccination.4445 Globally COVID-19 cases have surpassed 600 million and in the United States alone over 94 million cases have been reported since the beginning of the pandemic. Over 6 million people have succumbed to COVID-19 globally including just over 1 million in the United States as of early September 2022.4647 The total number of reported COVID-19 cases in Shelby County as of 31st 2022 is 267149 with a cumulative case rate of 28523 per 100000 population and 3399 deaths with a cumulative death rate of 363 per 100000.27 Only 61.8 of residents in Shelby County have received at least one dose of vaccine as of July 31 2022. Only 14 of residents are up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccinations meaning they have received all recommended doses in the primary series and all recommended boosters for which they are eligible.28 For residents who have received at least one dose the highest rate of vaccination is among older adults aged 65-74yrs 92.4 followed by those aged 75yrs and older 91.1 then 55-64yrs old 79.9 and 45-54yrs old 76.9 respectively. The lowest vaccination rate is among children aged 0 - 4yrs 2.7 followed by 5  11yrs 24 and 12-17yrs 54.7.36 OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY Obesity and a sedentary lifestyle are risk factors for the top three leading causes of death in S1 helby County heart disease cancer and cerebrovascular disease. In Shelby County 40 of adults aged 18 and older reported being obese and 29 report having no leisure-time physical activity in 2020.12 According to the Tennessee Department of Education 38.8 of public school students in Shelby County were overweight or obese.13 Among high school students who participated in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey in Shelby 2 County 19.2 were overweight or obese compared to 15.5 for students participating nationally.14 Among these Shelby County students 28 reported that in the past week they were not physically active for at least 60 minutes on any one day and 27.7 reported that they watched television for 3 or more hours per day on an average school day. Twice as many high school students report not eating any vegetables in the previous seven days in Shelby County compared to nationally.14 Evidence suggests that food deserts are correlated with overweight and obesity. The County Health Rankings reports a food environment index of 7.3 in Shelby County compared to Tennessee at 6.2.16 The index ranges from 0 worst to 10 best taking into account proximity to healthy foods and income. AGING POPULATION The proportion of the population aged 65 and older is increasing in Shelby County. There were about 12500 more people 65 and older in 2020 than there were in 2017. The number of Alzheimers deaths has decreased by 54 in the same time period.4 Additionally with an aging population falls and injuries become important issues. Families will increasingly be caring for elderly loved ones and may be unprepared to handle their new caregiver role. Habitat for Humanity in Shelby County has an initiative to assess home environments and make them safer to enable more Shelby County residents to safely age in place rather than having to relocate to assisted living facilities.17 Partnering with organizations focused on housing issues and serving our aging population and supporting these kinds of initiatives would be an excellent way to serve our communities as the number of older residents continues to increase.

The leading causes of infant death in Shelby County are Sudden Unexpected Infant Deaths SUID 23 prematurity or low birth weight 18 and congenital defects 17.4 Sleep-related infant deaths are a substantial contributor to SUID.4 4 5 6 RR7 8 RR9 10 RR11 RR12
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND OPIOIDS Substance use disorder is a growing problem in Shelby County. In 2020 the overall age-adjusted mortality rate of fatal drug overdose was 50 deaths per 100000 population.135 This is in comparison to the United States with an age-adjusted mortality rate of 28.2 per 100000 population and Tennessee with a rate of 45.6 per 100000.4950 51 The rate of opioid-related fatal overdoses in Shelby County remained lower than the rate for Tennessee overall from 2016 through 2018 but met and surpassed it in 2019 and 2020.51 The age-adjusted opioid-related mortality rate in 2020 for Shelby County was 42 deaths per 100000 compared to 36 deaths per 100000 in Tennessee.51 Over the last few years synthetic opioids primarily Fentanyl have become the greatest concern in Shelby County. Fentanyl can be disguised as other drugs which allows users to unknowingly ingest more than intended leading to an overdose. 34 According to the Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance System YRBSS for Shelby County in 2019 an estimated 18.5 of adolescents aged 12-17 had taken a prescription pain medicine without a doctors prescription or differently than how a doctor told them to use it.14 In Shelby County 26.5 of high school students reported being offered sold or given an illegal drug on school property14

The life expectancy in District 2 is 81.08 years old the highest of all the districts.1
DISTRICT SPECIFIC ISSUES
AGING POPULATION
The median age is 40 which is higher than the Shelby County median age of 35.4 and the third highest among the 13 districts in Shelby County.1 This could be attributed to the high life expectancy and higher than average median age of residents in this district. Average life expectancy for District 2 is 78 years.
CANCER HEART DISEASE  ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
Cancer Heart Disease and Alzheimers Disease were the three top leading causes of death in District 2.4 Additional risk factors that may increase a persons chances of developing cancer include advanced age higher exposure to radiation including sunlight high alcohol consumption and tobacco use.10 Other risk factors for heart disease include unhealthy cholesterol levels as well as high alcohol use. It is scientifically well documented that modifiable risk factors such as sedentary lifestyle obesity unhealthy diet and smoking are major causes of heart disease and stroke. Modifiable risk factors can be mitigated by managing cardiovascular risk factors smoking diabetes hypertension and obesity.9
UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES
As people age their risk of falling increases. It is estimated that there are about 9500 deaths in older Americans related to falls and about 1800 falls directly result in death each year. Fall related injuries are the number one reason a person 65 years of age or older visits the emergency room. Fall mortality rates increase across all genders and races as a person ages. Risk factors associated with falls include advanced age medication use cognitive impairment and sensory deficits.8 Habitat for Humanity of Memphis Aging in Place AIP Program serves residents 60 years and older by providing home repairs and modifications that improve accessibility and mobility within the home. This can reduce falls and help residents live in their own home longer.17
OPPORTUNITIES
The health status of residents in District 2 is higher than most districts in the county. This is likely due to higher socioeconomic status and increased access to health insurance and health care.

Advocates say South Memphis is one of the hardest-hit and often forgotten areas in the city when it comes to drug addiction.

MEMPHIS Tenn.  When many eyes were focused on the COVID-19 pandemic over the last 3 years another crisis was brewing and hitting south Memphis hard.
Deaths from opioid and other drug addictions have gone up since 2020 and local organizations along with the Shelby County Drug Court are working to get more people the treatment they need.
The Shelby County Drug Court along with Flanders Field and other organizations gave out care packages to those in south Memphis on Saturday.
It's about building relationships and starting the alliances so that when somebody is ready to get help they know who to go to Ben Owen the founder of Flanders Field and We Fight Monsters said.
Those packages included hygiene items and other utensils. The other goal was to give a helping hand and invite those in South Memphis who might be dealing with drug addiction to treatment.
If you cant find the light in the dark you might be the light so shine brightly Josh Snead said. Its given me purpose.
Snead has been sober for nearly 4 months  ever since he began his journey through the Shelby County Drug Courts drug rehabilitation program.
Instead of just sending them to jail we try to put them into a rehabilitation program Drug Court Judge Lee Wilson said. In that program we have intensive outpatient inpatient and long-term treatment.
The program is 18 months about 1 and a half years and Judge Wilson says the goal is to stop the revolving door at 201 Poplar particularly the cases dealing with individuals addicted to a substance.
If no ones helped them they just can go in do a little time in jail go right back to jail doing what they were doing Judge Wilson said. Its because the root cause has not been addressed which is the addiction to these drugs out here.
Since the beginning of this year alone Memphis Police Department's Heroin Overdose Response team has investigated over 120 non-fatal opioid-related overdoses and about 23 possible deaths.
Many of them due to fentanyl and South Memphis is one of the hardest-hit areas in the city.
That's why Saturday Josh joined the Shelby County Drug Court and other organizations to share a message of hope and invite others in South Memphis who may suffer from drug addiction to sobriety.
It was easier to supply my drug habit than it was to feed myself. Thats the world that we live in right now Snead said. Dont be scared. We understand. There are people out here walking those same roads  in your shoes.
Josh is four months into the Drug Courts program Bryan Owens graduated from the program over a decade ago and said the program gave him a new life.
In the beginning I only had hope that theres a different future now I have faith that theres a different future Owens said. Recovery is possible. It doesnt matter how far down the road you are everybody can recover and change.

One of the most urgent topics in Tennessee right now is criminal justice reform. With 80 of all Tennessee crimes relating to drugs in one way or another obviously the conversation must include treatment for mental health and substance use disorder.
Fortunately this seems to be the case. Shortly after Memphis' crimes hit national media a legislator tweeted We need a comprehensive rebuild of the entire criminal justice system. That means more support for mental health and substance abuse.
Science backs this statement up. According to a meta-analysis of almost 50 studies opioid-related interventions before during and after incarceration decrease opioid-related overdose and mortality reduce opioid use and other risky behaviors during and after incarceration and improve retention in addiction treatment after prison release.
About two-thirds of all incarcerated Tennesseans meet the criteria for a diagnosable substance use disorder. This is a truly substantial population that would benefit from receiving evidence-based treatment such as medications for opioid use disorder.

Treatment programs help prevent relapse
As of now only one jail in the entire state Jefferson County offers a program that assesses a person upon intake initiates a course of treatment and immediately connects that individual to a treatment program outside the jail. This program was implemented in October 2021.
Many people are diverted from the criminal justice system into drug courts and this does have a tremendous impact. These efforts were bolstered by the recent Alternatives to Incarceration Act which incentivizes local governments to develop alternatives to incarceration prohibits the revocation of parole upon one instance of a technical violation and opens drug court eligibility to people that were otherwise ineligible.
Another recent bill the Reentry Success Act holds individuals accountable for treatment through supervision programs while shortening time between parole hearings. Both of these bills passed in 2021.
In the meantime there remain individuals who would significantly benefit from receiving treatment within correctional facilities themselves. Evidence-based treatment for mental health and substance use disorders delivered during incarceration reduces symptoms and disciplinary problems improves post-release adjustment and decreases recidivism risk.

Arguably the most dangerous period of time for a person with a substance use disorder involved in the criminal justice system is the first two weeks after they are released back into the community. If the person has not received or continued treatment they face a strong risk of relapse and potentially fatal overdose.
Sometimes this relapse includes drug-related crimes. Preventing that relapse is the key to keeping Tennesseans alive and out of prison.
The changes to telehealth policy have enabled the treatment program and coordination employed at the rural Jefferson County jail. This is crucial as the rate of incarceration is increasing the most in rural areas while these facilities tend to have the fewest resources.
However this program connects inmates to resources they might otherwise not have which should reduce their risk of overdose and recidivism. The SMART Initiative is watching this program closely and will be detailing future results.

Fatal overdoses in Shelby County remain in the hundreds every year and recently finalized data from the Tennessee Department of Health shows that fentanyl continues to be a major driver of those fatalities. And non-fatal overdoses are still happening by thousands every year in Shelby County.
In 2021 549 people died after fatally overdosing on a substance and an additional 3111 overdose events were recorded by hospitals in Shelby County.
Fentanyl is now the leading drug behind fatal overdoses according to the Tennessee Department of Health.

David Fuller a Regional Overdose Prevention Specialist with the Memphis Area Prevention Coalition runs trainings and facilities access to resources that can empower an individual to know what to do when someone is experiencing an overdose and possibly prevent a death.
He talked to The Commercial Appeal about resources facts and myths around overdoses and preventing fatalities.
Who is at risk for exposure to fentanyl
In short nearly anybody.
Fentanyl is most commonly associated with opioid abuse but that association is an incomplete picture.
It's not a new drug but it's popularity on the streets has soared since 2011 because it makes drugs more powerful and cheaper to produce. Illicit dealers are adding fentanyl to cocaine and methamphetamines  i.e. meth crank ice. Addiction specialists have noted it's prevalent in counterfeit drugs. In some cases it's been found in marijuana.
According to the state department of health it is now the number one substance driving fatal overdoses and is responsible for more than 50 of deaths. Its prevalence means that it's not only individuals with active addictions that are at risk of knowingly or unknowingly consuming fentanyl  it is also claiming the lives of individuals in Tennessee who may buy a single counterfeit pill or try a drug for the first time.
All demographics Fuller said are vulnerable to fentanyl overdoses. Trends among demographics may change over time but the nature of the problem continues to grow and expand. It could affect anyone. So therefore the solution needs to be available to everyone.
What can I do to avoid overdosing on fentanyl
The only surefire way to avoid fentanyl exposure is to not consume illicit drugs. Outside of complete abstinence  naloxone more commonly known by the brand name Narcan is an FDA-approved medication that will rapidly reverse an overdose.
Narcan was recently approved for over-the-counter sale nationally. Organizations in Memphis and Shelby County have been organizing trainings around its application and distributing Narcan for free to anyone interested in keeping it on hand.
Though Narcan is available over the counter at drugstores like CVS or Walgreens consumers will have to pay out of pocket for the medication.
Where can I find free Narcan in Shelby County
The exact number of organizations that provide free Narcan fluctuates as some nonprofits or churches may offer the occasional training session. But there are a handful of organizations that offer regular access to training Narcan or both. Those organizations are listed below.
Memphis Area Prevention Coalition offers training and Narcan. You can reach out to Fuller directly at 901-484-2852 or email him at davidmemphisprevention.org.
The Shelby County Health Department will sometimes offer overdose harm reduction kits and other resources. On June 10 from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. health department employees will be handing out these kits at the Hickory Hill Community Center as part of the Background Friendly Career Fair. Each kit will contain two doses of naloxone nasal spray and 10 fentanyl test strips.
A Betor Way is an independent nonprofit that offers a range of harm reduction tools including Narcan fentanyl test strips and clean needle exchanges. For more information about their services email lisaabetorway.org.
Tennessee REDLINE is a hotline people can call to access information about inpatient treatment and detox for substance abuse disorders. You can call or text 800-889-9789 for confidential referrals.

In 2017 Tennessee providers wrote 94.4 opioid prescriptions for every 100 persons the third highest prescribing rate in the country. The good news This represents a 25-percent decline in the states opioid prescribing rate since 2013 according to the Center for Disease Control.
In Tennessee data from the state Department of Health shows 1776 Tennesseans died from drug overdoses in 2017 with prescription opioids continuing to be the most common drugs associated with overdose deaths. The data also showed a 12 percent decrease in deaths involving prescription opioids in 2017 from 2016 which is significant progress in one year.
The event will be a comprehensive overview of the effects of opioid abuse
Many are stepping up their efforts. For instance Cigna has reduced opioid prescriptions by 25 and is working to reduce opioid overdoses 25 by 2020.

MEMPHIS Tenn.  Friday an organization formed to combat substance abuse is honoring Tennessee Day of Hope an effort to inspire and help those struggling with addiction and mental health issues. Gov. Bill Lee proclaimed March 10 2023 as Day of Hope urging communities to get involved.

Since the beginning of this year Memphis Police's Heroin Overdose Response Team has investigated 120 opioid-related overdoses and 23 possible deaths.
What we want people to know is that we are advocating for people who cannot advocate for themselves. This is a community that nobody prays for that nobody advocates for said Sam Tubikh Viral Hepatitis and HIV Prevention Coordinator MAPC. Not only do we supply them with clean injecting supplies we also get the dirties off the street. We provide Narcan. We provide testing. We have treatment representatives on site for when they are ready. We build relationships. The whole point of harm reduction is that were meeting them where theyre at.
We want them to know that you know there is hope regardless. Im a person of long-term recovery you know.

The deadly opioid is nearly 100 times more powerful than Morphine.
MEMPHIS Tenn.  The Tennessee District Attorneys General Conference TNDAGC announced today the launch of its newest awareness effort Fentanyl The Deadliest High which is aimed at educating Tennesseans across the state about the extreme dangers of fentanyl the most prevalent synthetic opioid in the United States. Mondays announcement is step one of a multi-layered months long campaign TNDAGC will wield against this rising danger.
Fentanyl-related overdoses have increased exponentially in Tennessee over the last few years. It is often illegally sold on the streets disguised as other drugs where users unknowingly take too much and ultimately overdose. A dose as small as two milligrams roughly equivalent to the weight of four grains of sand is considered lethal to the average person.
While the use of fentanyl has increased awareness of the drug has not. District attorneys conducted focus groups with middle and high schoolers across the state to determine the awareness level of fentanyl and its dangers. Findings from these focus groups directed the approach for the awareness effort which is primarily directed toward 13- to 18-year-old Tennesseans.
It is vital that we work to educate Tennessee on the grim reality that is the rise of fentanyl in our great state said Gen. Amy Weirich 30th district attorney general and executive president of the TNDAGC We find it unacceptable to stand by and not do all that is in our power to reverse the course of fentanyl abuse in Tennessee. With this education effort we begin the process of ending fentanyl and its effects in the Volunteer State.
In our research we discovered a lack of education around the dangers and prevalence of fentanyl and opioids in general said Guy Jones executive director of TNDAGC Our youth are our future. It is with that in mind that we work to inform them on the realities of addiction and overdose. We want this effort to be the start of the end of fentanyl and deadly drug abuse in Tennessee and we must work together to make this goal a reality.
The awareness effort will heavily utilize social media to reach students across the state and disseminate the message of the deadly nature of fentanyl especially with the risks associated with street drug usage. Those interested in learning more can visit TheDeadliestHigh.com.

The embattled Memphis judge under indictment whos run into nothing but trouble in her short time on the bench resigned after her bond was revoked for having cocaine in her system.
Judge Andrewnetta Melissa Boyd 59 went to jail last week after the failed drug tests. This appeared to be the last straw for Boyd who was facing removal by the Tennessee General Assembly. In January the Tennessee Board of Judicial Conduct sent Lt. Gov. Randy McNally and Assembly Speaker Cameron Sexton a letter recommending that the Assembly kick Boyd out of office. The letter also detailed how her former campaign manager in December 2022 found a plate with a line of suspected cocaine on it in her closet.
Her lawyers sent the Administrative Office of the Courts a letter submitting her resignation late last month. She initially was going to resign at the end of May but in a letter sent Tuesday she moved up her date.
Accordingly please treat this letter as Judge Boyds indication that she is resigning from her position as a Criminal Court Judge for the 30th Judicial District at Memphis effective immediately Tuesdays letter said.
At the court hearing last week revoking her bond Boyds attorney said his client was in full relapse.
I think thats very obvious to the court attorney Art Horne said according to CBS affiliate WREG. Putting Ms. Boyd in jail and letting her detox and whatever doesnt fix the long-term problem.
But Boyds actions showed she was just thumbing her nose at the courts orders prosecutors said.
She is basically thumbing her nose at the court saying I am not going to do one thing that you ordered me to do. I am not going to call into pretrial supervision. I am not going to go by the office I am not going to submit to drug screens  I am not going to stop using cocaine said Nina Seiler Assistant District Attorney of the 28th Judicial District according to WREG.
The judge agreed with prosecutors saying Boyd has refused help to address her drug problem. He sent her to jail until her criminal trial which is slated to start later this month.
As LawCrime previously reported a grand jury indicted Boyd in December on charges of coercion of a witness and harassment records show. According to the complaint obtained by the Memphis Commercial Appeal Boyd is accused of pressuring her campaign manager to recant the statements she made to a judicial oversight body about Boyds use of marijuana and cocaine since taking office last year. Boyd also would show up at the campaign managers home and berate her the Commercial Appeal reported.
Boyd reportedly told the campaign manager to shut up and to not mess with her because shes a judge.
The judge elected in August 2022 as Division IX judge of the 30th Judicial District Criminal Court in Memphis took a leave of absence in May to address an illness. But in reality documents reviewed by LawCrime say she was suspended by the Tennessee Board of Judicial Conduct that oversees judges. The board suspended her on May 22 for no more than six months due to allegations of drug use and inappropriate behavior the documents said. The suspension was extended in December.
More on LawCrimeI have also faltered Judge resigns after sending wild text messages about genitals boring testimony and pretty cops during murder trial
On Nov. 30 2022 the board received a complaint alleging she was threatening and intimidating an acquaintance and that she was abusing alcohol. Boyd was required to respond in writing but missed the deadline by more than a month the document said. The investigation was expanded in March after Boyd was discovered sitting outside the acquaintances residence around 230 a.m.
During the incident Judge Boyd texted pictures of this individuals property and sent text messages which accused this person of having someone in the home investigators wrote.
Boyd wrote to the board on April 10 admitting to sending the text messages and acknowledging that it was inappropriate. She also admitted she had failed to respond to the board in a timely fashion blaming it on the deaths of several family members.
Then the board said it was expanding the investigation for a third time after Boyd allegedly admitted to having a substance abuse problem. Boyd acknowledged to the board on May 5 that she did indeed have an issue.
Boyds behavior was not appropriate the board wrote.
When any judge but especially a judge who adjudicates substance abuse or chemical dependency related matters such as Judge Boyd has alcohol andor substance abuse issues respect for the judiciary and the administration of justice suffers the board wrote. Clearly the public is more likely to respect and have confidence in the integrity and quality of justice administered by a judge if the judge has complied with the same standards of conduct he or she is responsible for applying to others. A judge who has drug or alcohol dependency issues does not inspire such confidence.
The board ordered Boyd to submit to a substance abuse evaluation and go to rehab if necessary. The Tennessee Lawyers Assistance Program which assists those in the law profession had to determine whether she was fit to return to the bench.
But the Board of Judicial Conduct on Oct. 31 issued a public reprimand of Boyd saying she failed to complete the substance abuse evaluation. It was her second reprimand of the year In May the board reprimanded her for asking for donations via social media for a school while wearing her judge robe which is a violation of judicial policy.

Fayette County Public Schools said the incident happened outside of the school Tuesday evening. Another student is in critical condition.

SOMERVILLE Tenn.  Two Fayette County Tennessee high school students are dead and another fighting for their life after a possible drug overdose just hours before a graduation ceremony at Fayette-Ware High School Tuesday the Fayette County Sheriff's Office said.
The Fayette County Sheriff's Office said they are investigating the incident as a drug overdose and aren't releasing additional information at this time.
Two teenage girls died while a third was taken to the hospital in critical condition. That student is now stable.
Chief Deputy Ray Garcia said Fayette county has been dealing with drug overdoses for a while now.
We know that across the nation we have seen overdoses spike and the numbers have increased greatly we've experienced that same phenomenon here in Fayette County Chief Deputy Ray Garcia said. And for it to happen to juveniles here at a school and on graduation night that is going to be very devastating to the community to the students to the teachers to the faculty.
The high school's graduation ceremony planned for Tuesday at 7 p.m. continued as planned.
Fayette-Ware is the only public high school in Fayette County so all the students that attend public school all filter in from all corners of the county to this one school Garcia said. So it is a situation where most all the students know each other or at least are familiar with each other so that has an impact.
The names of the individuals involved have not been released as they are all minors.
This is a developing story. We are working to learn more information and will post updates here as we get them.

The Memphis College of Art not only wants you to see red they also want you to call the redline. Local 24 anchor Katina Rankin explains in our local good news.
Do you recognize these faces They are the new faces of opioid addiction.
And the opioid epidemic in Shelby County has the Memphis College of Art getting creative and using art to raise awareness about the addiction.
Art students have created posters that read Do not be invisible. Get help Opioid addiction can happen to any of us and Not all addiction is seen. And theres this a human inside a medicine bottle.
Theyre appealing to that segment of our society thats very aware of the artistic side of things said Shelby County Mayor Mark Luttrell.
Luttrell says the new campaign ad by the College of Art is just one way the county is partnering with people to spread awareness of abusive opioid use. He says there are bus wraps PSAs movie theater ads and billboards. Plus he says if you or someone you know needs help they want you to see red and call the redline hotline. Its a lifeline to the Memphis Crisis Center.
The aggressive approach he says is simple.
Give people some pointers on things they need to look for and what they need to do in their sphere of influence said Luttrell.
Speaking to a standing-room-only crowd of about 100 federal state and local law enforcement officials at the U.S. district courthouse in Memphis on Thursday Attorney General Jeff Sessions expressed appreciation for law enforcement and addressed violent crime. He said that every lawful tool will be used to take the most violent offenders off our streets.
Citing a 43-percent increase in homicides last year in Memphis he said these arent just numbers.
These are people our citizens whose safety and lives are at stake everyday he said. They are people like the residents in Sycamore Lake Apartments here in northeast Memphis. Last week two men were shot there and killed during a drug deal according to the local detectives who worked the case. Tragically this is not an uncommon thing there since 2014 seven people including a soon-to-be mother and her unborn baby were murdered in just that apartment complex.
Sessions also decried incidents of violent crime in other cities saying this is not acceptable in America.
Congressman David Kustoff who welcomed and introduced Sessions said law enforcement has been under siege for the last several years and that the country is facing an uphill battle with violent crime.
However he said he believes our law enforcement here is some of the finest and most capable law enforcement anywhere in the nation he said. West Tennesseans don't back down from a challenge.
Linking drugs crime and death Sessions addressed opioid abuse urged protection of the country's southern border and vowed to dismantle transnational cartels drug trafficking and gangs.
If you are a gang member know this You think you are targeting us. Well we are targeting you he said. We will find you. We will devastate your networks. We will starve your revenue sources deplete your ranks and seize your profits. We will not concede a single block or single street corner to illegal gangs.
Sessions said 230 more Assistant United States attorneys will be hired nationwide and he reiterated that he has empowered federal prosecutors to charge and pursue the most serious readily provable offense in each case.
To reduce opioid abuse deaths and crime he said prevention programs in the long run are the most important and effective thing we can do.
He thanked law enforcement and vowed that the Department of Justice will support and back officers. He also said the DOJ will stand firm against wrongdoing or abuse or civil rights violations by our police.
Sessions arrived in Memphis on Wednesday night to meet with officials law enforcement and faith leaders on Thursday.
He asked faith leaders for advice they could share about what is effective in Memphis said DeAndre Brown executive director of Lifeline to Success which works with ex-offenders. Brown met with Sessions in a group of about a dozen people.
What has worked for us is the ability to build relationships with individuals Brown said. When you only want to incarcerate you dont get to the root of the problem. Youre recycling people.
Pastor Keith Norman said he was invited to meet with Sessions but chose not to attend. He said it appeared to him that Sessions' platform has already been built and that he had already made decisions to enforce stiffer penalties which is opposite of any agenda I would have wanted to discuss with him.
More than 100 demonstrators from the Memphis chapters of the NAACP Black Lives Matter and other groups urged officials to boycott Sessions and gathered outside Memphis City Hall before marching to the federal building to protest his visit.
Following Sessions' speech Congressman Steve Cohen likened Sessions' remarks to something out of the '50s or '60s.
Cohen said there is a smart way to attack crime and theres a dumb way to attack crime. The dumb way is to return to the era where we failed because we locked up so many people at 30000 a year that the only people that were happy about his approach are the private prison industry who make money out of peoples miseries and crime.
Steve Mulroy a professor of law at the University of Memphis called Sessions' priorities misguided.
Charging the harshest way possible is not required by law and is opposite from the direction our mass-incarceration-crazy society needs to go he said.
Sessions has addressed law enforcement in other states including to Missouri Texas Virginia and New York after being sworn in Feb. 9.
He mentioned the violent crime in Memphis as well as Baltimore Chicago and Milwaukee in speeches this year.
In Memphis last year 228 people were killed breaking a previous record of 213 in 1993. There have been 84 homicides in 2017 compared to 91 during the same time frame last year according to the Memphis Police Department.
On Monday this week three people were injured in a shooting during a vigil for an 18-year-old girl who was killed last year Downtown.
On Tuesday a 15-year-old girl was arrested and charged with killing a 17-year-old boy last month outside a store in Binghamton.
Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland met with Sessions on Thursday and requested more federal resources to fight violent crime including grant funding more agents for the Multi-Agency Gang Unit and Organized Crime Unit and to continue a collaborative review of the police department with the federal Office of Community Oriented Policing Services.
Memphis police Director Michael Rallings applauded Sessions for meeting with clergy and community partners.
We all have a role Rallings said. We cannot expect law enforcement to solve every problem that plagues society.
Rallings and his command staff gathered briefly outside the federal building after meeting with Sessions.
I think it went well Rallings said quickly before walking into City Hall.
Memphis Police Deputy Director Mike Ryall said that it was very positive. A good collective back and forth.

Three 6 Mafia rapper Gangsta Boo died from an fentanyl and cocaine overdose aged 43 on New Year's Day 2023.
The autopsy report for the musical artist whose real name was Lola Mitchell states she died from an accidental overdose brought on by fentanyl cocaine and alcohol.
The day before her death Gangsta Boo attended a concert in her native Memphis Saturday with her brother who needed to be hospitalized after suffering an overdose himself which he recovered from.
Sources said that 'narcotics were found on her person' as authorities were probing the incident.
According to FOX13 Memphis at the time Gangsta Boo was found dead at around 4 p.m. on New Year's Day. DJ Paul a member of Three 6 Mafia posted an apparent memorial image of Gangsta Boo working on a turntable.
Tragic loss Three 6 Mafia rapper Gangsta Boo died from an fentanyl and cocaine overdose aged 43 on New Year's Day 2023 pictured 2022
It takes just a small dose of fentanyl to cause an overdose. Just two milligrams - the equivalent of five grains of salt - is enough to cause death. Gangsta Boo's cause of death was revealed by FOX13 Memphis.
Fentanyl was originally developed in Belgium in the 1950s to aid cancer patients with their pain management.
Given its extreme potency it has become popular amongst recreational drug users.
Overdose deaths linked to synthetic opioids like fentanyl jumped from nearly 10000 in 2015 to nearly 20000 in 2016 - surpassing common opioid painkillers and heroin for the first time.
The ultra-strong opioid being cut with virtually every street drug in the country killed a record 75000 Americans in 2021 the equivalent of 1500 lives lost every week.
Because it is cut into other popular drugs many people who die of overdoses do not know they are taking fentanyl. Fentanyl has been partially blamed for America's sharp fall in life-expectancy over the past three years.
Rapper Coolio died from a fentanyl overdose aged 59 in September 2022.
The Gangsta's Paradise hitmaker whose real name was Artis Leon Ivey Jr also had traces of heroin and methamphetamines in his system when he was found dead on September 28 on the bathroom floor of a friend's LA home.

What is fentanyl and why is it so dangerous Fentanyl was originally developed in Belgium in the 1950s to aid cancer patients with their pain management. Given its extreme potency it has become popular amongst recreational drug users. Overdose deaths linked to synthetic opioids like fentanyl jumped from nearly 10000 in 2015 to nearly 20000 in 2016 - surpassing common opioid painkillers and heroin for the first time. The ultra-strong opioid being cut with virtually every street drug in the country killed a record 75000 Americans in 2021 the equivalent of 1500 lives lost every week. It is often added to heroin because it creates the same high as the drug with the effects biologically identical. But it can be up to 50 times more potent than heroin according to officials in the US. In the US fentanyl is classified as a schedule II drug - indicating it has some medical use but it has a strong potential to be abused and can create psychological and physical dependence.

Lola Mitchell AKA Gangsta Boo -- a former member of Three 6 Mafia and a pioneer of female rap -- has died.
The hip hop star's passing was confirmed by her former labelmate DJ Paul -- who threw up a photo of her on IG ... seemingly as a tribute. Several prominent artists commented with messages of condolences. The exact circumstances surrounding her death are unknown.
Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.
Gangsta Boo's career officially started in the '90s when she linked up with Paul Juicy J and other founding members of the rap group -- which included the likes of Lord Infamous Crunchy Black Koopsta Knicca and more. Gangsta Boo was one of the only female rappers with the crew but she held her own and paved her own lane for years as part of T6M.
In addition to her own solo albums that she was cranking out at the time -- to much acclaim -- Gangsta was also featured on Three 6 Mafia's first 5 studio albums ... including their debut record in '95's Mystic Stylez ... as well as other notable projects like 'Chapter 1' 'When the Smoke Clears' and even the 'Choices' album that served as the soundtrack to the movie.
Gangsta Boo left Three 6 in the early 2000s but went on to have a notable career thereafter -- cranking out another solo studio album and several mixtapes through the rest of the aughts and 2010s. This of course doesn't include the countless features she's been a part of -- working with rap titans like Gucci Mane Lil Jon OutKast E-40 T.I. The Game and more.
She continued rapping into the 2020s as well ... often collaborating with Killer Mike and El-P in their hip hop duo Run The Jewels. Gangsta Boo was also continuing to partner up with different media outlets to put out music such as UPROXX and others.

MEMPHIS Tenn. -- Elvis Presley was a drug addict and was hospitalized under a false name for treatment of drug abuse in 1973 a jury was told Friday.
An internal medicine specialist gave details of Presley's bouts with drugs after labeling as 'outrageous and dangerous' the supply of narcotics Presley allegedly received from his physician during the last two years and seven months of the rock 'n' roll king's life.

Dr. George Nichopoulos Presley's doctor of 11 years is on trial on 14 felony counts of overprescribing addictive drugs to Presley singer Jerry Lee Lewis himself and eight others.
If convicted on all counts he could be sentenced to 140 years in prison fined 280000 and lose his medical license.
Prosecutor James Wilson asked Dr. Alvin Cummins to characterize Nichopoulos practices of prescribing 19000 uppers downers and painkillers for Presley over the 30-month period.

'They constituted an outrageous and dangerous overuse of drugs' Cummins said.
Referring to medical records Cummins revealed under the questioning of prosecutors that Presley was hospitalized three different times for a total of 48 days between Oct. 15 1973 and Sept. 25 1975.
Cummins said the records showed that Presley was treated at Baptist Hospital from Oct. 15 until Nov. 1 1973 from Jan. 28 to Feb. 13 1975 and from Aug. 21 to Sept. 25 1975.
Wilson asked Cummins about notations from consulting physicians during the first hospitalization.
'Can you tell me what they were doing' Wilson asked.
'They were withdrawing him from narcotic drugs' Cummins answered.
The trial ended its third week with defense attorney James Neal attempting an cross-examination pointing to notes in Presley's hospital charts that showed Nichopoulos ordered placebos in place of hard drugs.
Cummins agreed that placebos were given on occasion but testified that Nichopoulos allowed Presley to take hard drugs at the same time.
Trying to bolster a defense argument that the superstar received drugs from many sources Neal also asked Cummins about drug screens of Presley while the singer was hospitalized.
Cummins showed the drug screens showed amphetamines in Presley's system though no ampetamines were prescribed while he was in the hospital.

'You're not aware that Mr. Presley was mailed amphetamines from the West Coast'
'No' Cummins answered.
The prosecution said that although Nichopoulos was the attending physician he did not sign the discharge papers as required when Presley was released but defense attorney James F. Neal indicated during cross-examination that Nichopoulos did not sign them because Presley was hospitalized under an assumed name.
'You said Baptist Hospital required a discharge summary' Neal asked.
'Yes' Cummins answered.
'Isn't it a fact that the hospital put a false name on this patient's records' Neal asked.
Cummins said this was true.
In the second hospitalization in 1975 the admission note said that Presley's chief complaint was abdominal problems. Doctors also noted that his face hands and the fronts of his legs were swollen.
In the third hospitalization later the same year Presley was treated for shortness of breath and swelling. A note from Nichopoulos in the medical records said Presley was showing 'progressive malaise.'
Between the second and third hospitalizations prosecutors said Nichopoulos prescribed 1679 addictive pills for Presley over a 205-day period -- 335 amphetamines 816 sedatives and 528 narcotics.
'Did you see any condition that would require this amount of drugs' the prosecutor asked.

Cummins answered the string of questions 'Absolutely not' 'Absolutely none' 'None whatsoever' and 'None.'
Elvis bloated at age 42 was found dead in a bathroom of his Memphis mansion on Aug. 16 1977. A state witness testified earlier that 14 drugs -- including 10 times the maximum accepted level of codeine - were found in blood and tissue samples sent to a California laboratory for analysis.
Although part of the results of the autopsy were revealed the first time the conclusions -- whether Presley died of drug abuse -- remain a secret. Prosecutors say the issue in the trial is whether Nichopoulos overprescribed -- not how Presley died.
Wilson asked Cummins a specialist in internal medicine and chairman of the gastroenterology department at the University of Tennessee Medical School here whether he had an opinion based on his review of the prescription records of whether Presley was addicted to drugs.
'Absolutely. He was addicted' Cummins said.
An emergency room visit wont break the cycle of drug or alcohol addiction but it is an opportune time to start patients on the path to recovery.
Thats the 17 years of ER experience from Dr. Ravi Madasu an emergency medicine specialist at Baptist Memorial Health Cares flagship East Memphis hospital talking. He has treated many who have overdosed and feel they hit a low point.
You see it in their face  theyre scared Madasu said. Theyre in disbelief of what happened sometimes. We hope its the thing that will spark the change.
Now Madasu and his colleagues in the emergency department an area once distanced from addiction care have the right tools to lead patients to long-term treatment.
Baptist partnered with Bartlett-based addiction medicine practice Integrated Addiction Care Associates IAC to launch the Center of Excellence for Addiction Medicine. Both sides feel it was a missing link in combating the opioid crisis and the myriad ER visits it has produced.
Baptist and IAC hope the program will reduce emergency room visits particularly those related to overdoses as those with addiction transition into recovery.
Patients who accept help at the ER are directed to IAC for evaluation and treated for addiction. Baptist is placing the program in both its hospitals and the Baptist Medical Group physician offices.
The program has been going on since the end of August with at least three ER patients daily being looped into the program according to Madasu.
Other health systems and hospitals are looking to bridge the gap between the emergency room and long-term addiction treatment across the U.S. in their own way. But no one else in Memphis is taking the approach Baptist and IAC are said David Stern CEO of IAC. They want this practice to be a model for other Memphis health systems he added.
The center also provides clinical research and physician education in addiction medicine according to Baptist. Stern said the program wants to increase addiction expertise in the West Tennessee area which has become an increased priority in the wake of the opioid crisis.
One treatment  doesnt treat addiction
People who have an addiction may receive excellent care in the emergency department but that care does not address the long-term issue of addiction Stern said.
Physicians traditionally are reluctant to address addiction he said as suggesting a patient has a drug or alcohol problem could offend them.
Its such a primal thing that you dont want to be accusatory Madasu said. Its better if they recognize it themselves.
Another problem is often there isnt a next step once an emergency room physician realizes there is an addiction problem so those physicians dont like to use screening questions that would help identify the substance use problem in the first place according to Stern.
Without follow-up the patient may wind up in the emergency room again following an overdose. Or worse that next overdose is lethal.
Addiction is a chronic brain disease Stern said. One treatment say with opioid overdose antidote Narcan doesnt treat addiction. It just revives a situation where someone may have died but they are alive again. It doesnt rid them of their illness.
A quick turnaround to treatment
Madasu has seen people treated for an overdose return to drug abuse after their time in the ER. Its why beginning the recovery process in the emergency room is key to the centers work he said.
Those patients need to recognize the problem at hand and ask for help before proceeding Madasu said. Its easier for someone who has overdosed on narcotics to do so because they had a life-threatening event he added.
We identify individuals that would be good candidates for the program and want to change Madasu said. Thats imperative. The patient needs to be engaged in it.
Baptist links up with an IAC addiction medicine specialist remotely to figure out a patients needs. The centers service is around the clock with two IAC doctors rotating shifts to be on call whenever Madasu and others in the ER need help Stern said.
Baptist doctors already have access to various other specialists through telemedicine so it made sense to also bring addiction specialists expertise into the emergency room he said.
Thanks to the telemedicine access the patient is able to meet an addiction specialist on-screen and get a next-day appointment set up.
Every patient that has been processed in this way has shown up the next day Stern said.
Getting addiction treatment from IAC is more like going to a primary care physician office due to its accessibility for Memphians said Baptist PR Director Ayoka Pond and is covered by most insurers including TennCare. This prevents the need to go to a far-flung treatment facility for months on end.
Theyre able to get care in their environment and learn how to cope in their environment Pond said.

MEMPHIS TN WMC - We're blessed to live along Memphis' beautiful parkway system with its lush trees and lovely homes. Every once in a while the litter in the grassy tree lined median that divides North Parkway gets our attention and it's time to clean up.
Amid discarded beer bottles chip bags and empty cigarette packs uncovered today was a small wrapper that's become a reality check for this reporter. Evidence of America's heroin epidemic was blowing in the litter right in front of our home.
The label on the empty plastic packet said Suboxone an antidote drug for those who abuse heroin or other opioids such as oxycodone. Under the brand name Suboxone the packet listed the pharmaceutical names for the drug buprenorphine and Naloxone also known as Narcan.
It just so happens Memphis Police Director Mike Rallings had Narcan on his mind today at the Memphis Rotary Club where he was the featured speaker for a standing room only lunchtime crowd.
We have a heroin epidemic that is sweeping the nation that we cannot ignore Rallings said. 122 Memphians died of a heroin overdose in 2016. The Fire Department issued almost 1700 doses of Narcan that brings people back from the brink of death and brings them back to life. So if the Fire Department had not been there and issued those doses of Narcan we would have an astronomical number of dead Memphians in Memphis and Shelby County.
If that does not shake you in your seat the police director said then something is wrong with you.
A quick check with Judge Tim Dwyer of Shelby County Drug Court confirms the rising tide of opioid addition in the Memphis area.
In 2014 over 28 of drug court defendants said prescription opiates and heroin were their drug of choice Dwyer said. In 2015 it was 36 percent. In 2016 it was around 43 percent.
How big is the problem The graphs on charts at the National Institutes of Health all show overdose deaths rising dramatically
The crisis is out of control in New Jersey. Gov. Chris Christie revealed today that EMTs and other first responders administered Narcan 10000 times statewide in 2016. The Governor devoted the lion's share of his 2017 State of the State address to the drug epidemic after 1600 overdose deaths in New Jersey from heroin and other opioids in 2016.
Our friends are dying. Our neighbors are dying. Our co-workers are dying. Our children are dying. Every day in numbers we cannot ignore Christie said.
The Governor called for increasing state funding for drug treatment and announced a one stop shop website for information on what to do when a loved one needs help. The Governor called for a robust new effort in New Jersey schools to educate children about opioids and the dangers of addiction.
Hoping and praying alone will not make it better. Arresting jailing and stigmatizing the victims will not make it better Christie said.
Back here in Memphis MPD Director Rallings told Rotarians We cannot ignore the heroin epidemic. We cannot ignore the epidemic of gangs. We cannot ignore the epidemic of violence in our community and we all are going to have to do something about it but the police director said it was up to the entire community with the MPD as a partner to devise a response to the drug crisis.
There's a good chance evidence of the opioid epidemic might be blowing in the wind on your street too.

A Memphis doctor who knows first-hand the pain of losing a child to an overdose is fighting to change medical education in Tennessee so there are more physicians throughout the state with addiction medicine expertise.
Dr. David Stern vice-chancellor for clinical affairs for the University of Tennessees College of Medicine and the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center recently presented his vision  which he calls an infrastructure proposal  to Gov. Bill Haslam's opioid working group.
Stern wants the state to allocate up to 26 million over six years along with third-party funding he's trying to find to fight the opioid epidemic. Abuse of the drug devastates thousands of families and costs the state more than 2 billion a year according to a Memphis-based health care economist.
He started the presentation with a portrait of Alan Roberts Stern his late son who died in 2008 from an overdose.
The death indelibly changed Stern and his wife Kathleen who painted the portrait after her son's death.

Almost a decade later he's a top leader of the public medical school in a state replete with suffering families  and he wants to change the system so their loved ones can get the help his son didn't.
Getting primary care doctors as versed on addiction as diabetes takes education
Tennessee doesn't have enough primary care doctors and the pool of physicians with expertise in addiction medicine is even more shallow  particularly in rural areas.
Stern wants to develop a network of health care professionals throughout the state who can help guide people to the treatment that is best for them whether it's abstinence or some type of medication-assisted treatment.

Primary care physicians used to send diabetic patients to endocrinologists to manage the disease. Now with diabetes rampant primary care doctors manage most patients with consultations from specialists who work closely with complicated patients.
It's the same thing in addiction. It has to be the primary care doctor is trained and is comfortable said Stern. I don't think we've given physicians tools to handle this.
He wants to train 10 primary care or family medicine graduates annually in a one-year addiction fellowship.
Stern doesn't want to set them adrift.

MoreChronic pain sufferers feel stigma amid opioid crackdown
The new primary care doctor with with a board certification in addiction medicine would go to a practice that is set set up with social workers and behavioral health providers to provide integrated coordinated care to people struggling with substance abuse disorders.
He also wants to set up a statewide network so data from electronic health records and results can be monitored.
Collecting data for research is important because the state needs to be able to learn what works Stern said.
Success Stern said could be returning to a long-term relationship or holding down a steady job wracking up years of being in recovery.
Stern wants families to have a 'village' to turn to for expertise. It eluded his family.
He and Kathleen an ophthalmologist know how easily someone struggling can be overlooked by medical professionals.
They tried to help their son a 23-year-old law student but it was too late.

We couldn't get ahead of this. It takes a village to treat someone but the village wasn't there said Stern. I want to make sure it's there.
Where is the money He's not sure.
Stern describes himself as exceedingly impatient person. He wants this initiative to be up and running yesterday last week last month.
He's looking all over for other funding and has traveled to Washington D.C. a few times to talk with federal lawmakers including the Senate's Health Education Labor and Pensions committee chaired by Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander.

Stern is asking the state to allocate money over six years to fund the research and clinical pilot to get the network set up.
It's a fraction of the 2 billion that substance abuse disorder costs Tennessee each year according to analysis by Teresa Waters a health care economist at UTHSC.
It's interesting that people who have heard it actually like this proposal and everyone wants to know where do you expect to get the funding for it said Stern. I don't really have the answer for it. This is very much a Tennessee problem to wrestle.

MoreWhy state AGs are targeting drug companies over opioids
Haslam's spokeswoman Jennifer Donnals said the governor is giving thoughtful consideration to all of the requests he has received as he works over the next several weeks to put together his proposed budget.
Stern said he would love to see the first class start next year but students are deciding right now what fellowships to do and he doesn't have the money in place.
Loan forgiveness lost income and his son
Stern is trying to harness Tennessee's expansive medical education resources to solve a problem that's rampant across the state in a way that would be among the first-of-its-kind.
He's working with all the medical schools and health systems across the state because the program would flourish only if there is collaboration from cities and colleges in Tennessee.
Stern's vision fills a gap and complements educational programs that are underway at universities from across the state each focusing on a different subset of the problem said Meharry Medical College's Lyle Cooper a program outreach coordinator with expertise in substance abuse and behavioral health.
Once the fellows get trained alongside other graduating students entering the work force it will be like a snowball said Cooper.
Given that across the nation about 1 percent of those who need treatment get it its critical to figure out new avenues Cooper said noting that Stern has been tireless since their first contact.
Primary care is among the least lucrative medical specialties and most newly graduated doctors are burdened with a mountain of debt  students coming out of the state's two medical schools had about 180000 in loans on average in 2015.
Stern wants to offer each of the fellows loan forgiveness in exchange for a commitment to being part of a rural addiction medicine network.
Stern worries people will be daunted by the price of his proposal.
But the cost of abuse disorders is jarring.
Costs range from 46.5 million for treating neonatal abstinence syndrome births to 122.6 million for incarcerated adults and 422.5 million for hospitalizations associated with opioid abuse.
Waters projects that there's 1.29 billion annually in lost income from 1 percent of adults out of the labor force.
Stern said he could pare back the number of yearly fellows but he thinks this is what is needed to really make in-roads in treating addiction.
Currently given the state of affairs with the number of overdoses the number of Hepatitis C cases we have in the East I think 26 million would be really well spent given the number of Tennesseans affected by this said Cooper. I never speak to someone who hasnt been touched by this.
For Stern losing one of his children recast his life. He thinks about Alan every day.
He gives his cell phone number out to people in Memphis who have a loved one struggling with addiction  and people call asking for help.
He doesn't want other parents to have to sprinkle their child's ashes.
You're dealing with docs we didn't really train to deal with this. We have to train them to deal with this. It's important for the state and it's important to me said Stern.
The only thing we could think is that we should be dead and he should be sprinkling our ashes. I'd like to create something that is robust so other parents don't have to do that.

Good morning from Memphis where Republicans easily held onto the senate seat formerly occupied by federal judge Mark Norris of Collierville. But first...
Addiction comes at a high cost.
There's the high cost to the addicts themselves the fleeting highs and aching lows that feeling your life is unraveling and realizing you're holding the string the fade away the trips to rehab or maybe sometimes eventually to the morgue. Then there's the high cost to the family of addicts to the grieving parents to the alienated siblings and  worst of all  to the children whose care takes a backseat to the addiction.
There's the high cost of the funerals that has nothing to do with the price of the casket.
Today The Commercial Appeal has two stories about addiction. First there's the devastating news from our Bob Mehr that Memphis singer-songwriter former Tigers basketball player recovering alcohol addict and St. John's United Methodist associate pastor of recovery ministries John Kilzer died in an out-of-state rehab facility. Second the city of Memphis is following others including Shelby County and Tennessee in suing pharmaceutical makers and distributors for allegedly fueling the opioid crisis currently ravaging the nation our Phillip Jackson reports.
I'd only recently become acquainted with Kilzer  who was scheduled to play this year's Beale Street Music Festival  after featuring a song from his new album Scars in one of The 901's closing Fadeout numbers in January his song American Blues fades out today's column. Bob pulls back the veil on Kilzer's inner struggles
Though St. Johns did not disclose any details about the circumstances of his death several of Kilzers friends and associates confirmed that the musician  whod battled alcohol issues much of his life but been sober since 2000  had been struggling with his addiction again. In recent days Kilzer had checked into an out-of-state rehab facility where his body was found on Tuesday they said. The news left those who knew Kilzer  in the Memphis music scene and the church and recovery communities where he was a beloved figure  in a state of shock and sadness.
Again addiction  whether alcohol opioids or whatever else  comes at a high cost.
But maybe it'll surprise you to know there's also a high cost to governments including Memphis'. The Shelby County Health Department which has a very good and helpful website on opioid addiction sums up the local impact
Opioid-related deaths are consistently rising throughout Shelby County with rates doubling in just three years. There were 854 opioid-related emergency department visits in Shelby County in 2018 alone and in 2017 more Shelby County residents died from opioid overdose than in car accidents.
That's just deaths though. Shelby County and Memphis together spend millions of dollars yearly on policing transporting sentencing imprisoning and treating people for addiction.
But who is responsible Although we can't overlook personal responsibility for addiction the Memphis lawsuit argues that pharmaceutical companies share in the responsibility accusing them of intentionally underplaying the addictive qualities of the opiates.
If that's the case the addicts their families and local governments shouldn't be left to bear the cost alone opioid addiction should come at a high cost to Big Pharma too.
Speaking of emergency care You can now text 911 in Memphis and Shelby County our Phillip Jackson reports.
Republican Paul Rose wins Senate race
Covington Republican and businessman Paul Rose easily won the special Senate District 32 election yesterday to replace GOP senator-turned-judge Mark Norris.

Although the company will have just shy of two dozen stores by the end of March they aren't pumping the brakes on growth after that. Kellum said dozens more are already being planned in east of Nashville and east of Denver. And those don't include the 500 applications the company has already gotten from people interested in opening a Buff City Soap franchise of their own Kellum said. That kind of growth potential makes the path to becoming the Starbucks of soap more clear. But Kellum doesn't just mean that in a store-on-every-corner kind of way. He wants to mimic Starbucks' ubiquity but more importantly he wants to achieve Starbucks' position as a lifestyle staple  not a special occasion treat  for his customers.

MEMPHIS Tennessee  One of the more surprising stories so far this week is the revelation that more people have died from drug overdoses in Shelby County since the pandemic began than COVID-19.
Officials say demand for opioids such as fentanyl has surged during the new coronavirus outbreak.
Now needle exchange programs are being expanded to help stop the deadly trend. This one was at Sycamore View and Shelby Oaks Drive in northeast Memphis. Drug users can exchange dirty needles get free narcan and get access to counseling if they want it.
Shelby County has seen 700 drug overdoses and 102 deaths since March 15th.

Sue Goodrum woke up to flashing lights outside her bedroom window after falling asleep early on a winter night in 2016.
Her 33-year-old son Daniel recently paralyzed in a car accident stayed with her at her house in the Frayser neighborhood of Memphis with his girlfriend and their 6-week old son.
A hallway and two closed doors separated Goodrum's room from her son's living space and a fan was blowing to drown out noise. When she saw the ambulance at about 930 p.m. she didn't think that it was coming to her house. But about 15 minutes later a gurney wheeled down her driveway.
I knew then this is Daniel she said. And I jumped up.
Goodrum's son Corey Goodrum known by his nickname Daniel overdosed that night and two people are charged with killing him by unlawfully distributing the heroin.

Other states including Delaware Florida Illinois Kansas Louisiana Michigan Minnesota New Hampshire New Jersey North Carolina Oklahoma Pennsylvania Rhode Island Vermont Washington West Virginia Wisconsin and Wyoming also have drug-induced homicide laws according to the Drug Policy Alliance.
Putting the pieces together
Gathering the evidence to bring charges after a person dies of an opioid overdose can be a challenge according to Metro Nashville Police Lt. Carlos Lara who leads narcotics investigations within the department's specialized investigations division.
The investigations require backtracking he said because often overdose victims are found alone.
Now were trying to  start putting the pieces together Lara said. Starting to dig deep to figure out who was the last person with this person do we have any information on who this person contacted to get the drugs.

He sees the murder charge as opposed to a drug distribution charge as another way to combat the opioid crisis.
Were trying to get rid of the drugs no matter what. This is another tool we have to fight this epidemic.
Officials reported at least 1451 people died from drug overdoses in Tennessee in 2015 but the true number is unknown and likely higher by the hundreds according to a USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee investigation.

That big heart
Sue Goodrum's son was born in Memphis on August 19 1982. Growing up he liked to fish with his brothers  one older and one younger  at Reelfoot Lake in northwest Tennessee about 100 miles north of Memphis.
A big guy at 6 feet 3 inches he loved sports playing football and basketball.
You knew when he came into a room Goodrum said. He loved to talk and he was going to make sure you heard him because he was loud. Always smiling. Always. He could be dead tired from working or whatever and he would be laughing about it and smiling about it. And very sensitive. Sad movies made him cry. This great big teddy bear but a sad movie is going to make him cry.
His Christian faith was important to him and he was not shy about talking to his friends about Jesus Goodrum said. He especially liked to be kind to the elderly and helped a neighbor who lived alone by mowing her lawn. After any argument with his mother he still called every night to say I love you.
He just had that big heart Goodrum said.
In November 2015 he was injured as a passenger in a car accident at Hollywood and Frayser Boulevard in Memphis breaking his neck in four places. He spent two months at Regional Medical Center and five weeks at a rehab facility unable to move below his chest. Eventually he could move one arm and he started to be able to feed himself.
In February 2016 just days after his release he had a doctor's appointment. But his name got overlooked and the ambulance that was supposed to pick him up didn't come Goodrum said. He had run out of all the medications he had been sent home with.
He decided to use that day she said. He told his girlfriend he was in pain and he wanted to use.
When emergency lights awoke her Goodrum asked her son's girlfriend what was going on.
She said Daniel overdosed on heroin.
The only thing I could think of was why didn't you wake me Goodrum said. If he was in pain we could have taken him to the hospital we could have done anything but that. And you have a baby here. Why didn't you wake me
Her response was she was scared she was scared I would get mad.
The girlfriend 28-year-old Haley High and the suspected dealer 30-year-old Jerrico Long are both charged with second-degree murder in his death.
In a previous case in 2013 18-year-old University of Memphis student Sharon Muir died in a heroin overdose. The state alleged that Eric Herbers bought the heroin to celebrate their one-month anniversary. He pleaded in an agreement for a sentence of eight years.
In another Tennessee case Marvin Pookie Foster was convicted in June of federal charges for selling heroin to a man who overdosed.
Cody E. Tettleton was found unresponsive in his pickup truck July 2 2014 in Halls about 45 miles northwest of Jackson. A farmer saw the truck and called authorities. Foster faces a recommended sentence of 25 years with no parole said U.S. Attorney Michael Dunavant.
At least seven other cases are pending in Shelby County involving people charged in overdose deaths.
Bertrand Ross Tuggle Jr. 53 who was born in Virginia and graduated from Auburn University died last year in Memphis from a lethal mix of fentanyl and heroin after a years long struggle with alcohol and prescription pills. He was found in his car in his driveway.
Two men Aaron Lipford 53 and Justin Slepicka 23 were charged with second-degree murder in his death.
Tuggle's mother Barbara Tuggle had heart problems and she died not long after her son.
What happened to him took a toll on her said her son Allen Tuggle.
To him the second-degree murder charge is more than fair.
In my opinion I think it's very fair and honestly I don't think it's steep enough if you ask me he said. In my opinion it should be life.
In Sumner County northeast of Nashville District Attorney Ray Whitley estimated several such cases had been prosecuted in recent years.
The law has been on the books more than a decade he said but the cases can be tricky because law enforcement must prove how someone got the deadly drugs.
A conviction of second-degree murder carries a possible prison term of 15 to 25 years with no chance at early release he said. He believes that consequence is appropriate for the crime.
Anything we can do to try and deter people from dispensing and using opioids we need to do he said. This is a tool we have and we ought to use it when we have the opportunity.
He believes prosecuting such crimes serves as a deterrent against drug distribution.
Is it effective
The Drug Policy Alliance which opposes the war on drugs and supports a new approach grounded in science compassion health and human rights said most laws charging murder for overdose deaths were passed in the 1980s and were reinvigorated in the wake of increasing overdose deaths in the last few years.
There is absolutely no evidence in support of the effectiveness of these laws for either reducing sales or use or reducing overdoses said Drug Policy Alliance senior staff attorney Lindsay LaSalle.

OpinionWe all have role to play in ending opioid crisis
Instead the policy group argues that such laws actually discourage people from making 911 calls for overdose victims for fear of prosecution.
On the other hand proven strategies are available to reduce the harms associated with drug misuse treat dependence and addiction improve immediate overdose responses enhance public safety and prevent fatalities the group said in a paper.
These strategies include expanding access to the lifesaving medicine naloxone and its associated training improving fact-based drug education for young people that includes an overdose prevention and response component enacting legal protections that encourage people to call for help for overdose victims training people how to prevent recognize and respond to an overdose increasing access to medication-assisted treatment including methadone and buprenorphine and implementing safe injection facilities.
In shock
Daniel Goodrum had previously struggled with addiction. At some point  his mom thinks in high school he started drinking and when he got older he developed a problem with pain pills. When they got too expensive he turned to heroin Sue Goodrum said.
The night of the overdose a detective came separating Goodrum and her husband from the girlfriend. The detective told Goodrum he was sorry. Her son didn't survive.
I can just still hear those words Goodrum said. You know they ring in your head. 'I'm sorry your son didn't make it.'
She went outside her house and started hitting the walls of the ramp that had been built for her son after his accident.
She was in shock.
But you have to hold yourself together she said. So that's what you do.

This Christmas a Cordova mom is asking for the communitys help to combat the heroin epidemic.
Becky Farruggia began a campaign to raise money for billboards to share a message about drug overdoses.
According to the U.S. Attorney Edward Stantons office so far in 2016 the Memphis Police Department has investigated 91 deadly heroin overdose cases and 288 heroin overdose cases where the person survived.
Blake Renfrow a father to 3 girls was 28 years old when he died from a heroin overdose.
He was the most loving sweet kid. he had a smile that would light up the room said Debra Easter Renfrows mother August 21st. He OD-ed and was found in our garage by my husband.
Easter said Blake moved to heroin after being on narcotics for a major surgery.
He hated it. He would tell me I hate this. I dont want to be this person. And he tried. He tried so hard to fight it and at at the end lost the battle' remembered Easter.
She said Blake had been clean for a few months before relapsing.
Weve heard whoever he was with that night just dropped him off at the house and left himcouldve knocked on our door couldve called 911. They just dropped him off and left him to die said Easter.
Farruggia knows her daughter Kelsie could have met the same end. Kelsie also struggled with heroin.
Today my daughter celebrates 90 days clean sober Farruggia said through tears.
Farruggias organization Hearts for Hope and Healing is raising money to bring billboards to raise awareness about drug overdoses to Memphis.
The signs by Tennessee Overdose Prevention were designed to remind people state law protects you from calling 911 if someone has overdosed. They also urge people to carry Naloxone an antidote that can reverse an overdose.
Easter fully supports Farruggias mission and knows her son would too.
Blake lost 9 buddies before he passed away and it never got any easier for him. Every time it happened it broke him and I know that he would want us to do everything we could to help others from losing the battle said Easter If we can help one family one kid not go through this it would be worth it.
Theres a spike in the number of opioid related overdoses and deaths in Shelby County.
Theres a spike in the number of opioid related overdoses and deaths in Shelby County.
According to a report released this week at least 18 people overdosed during the first two weeks of January. Of that number 10 people died.
We talked to addiction specialists at Turning Point in Southaven Mississippi to find out why this is happening.
It reminds us that work still needs to be done and were doing it says Brett Martin.
Martin is the Public Relations manager for Turning Point in Southaven Mississippi. He says its heartbreaking that ten people have died in just two weeks in Shelby County from overdosing.
Martin says spikes in opioid-related deaths are typically seen in young people. That isnt the case with these latest numbers.
The average age is 47-year-old white men so that tells us not only do we have an opioid epidemic but we have an addiction epidemic. Weve gotta get down to the root problems of why people continue to turn to these substances to cope says Martin.
Turning Point launched its Another Chance initiative last month.
We know just with talking with people theyre having to revive the same person sometimes twice a day says Martin.
Theyre hoping local first responders will leave one of these cards with people who survive an opioid overdose to let them know help is here.
That person can call us and maybe we can get them into one of our programs or a program that fits them says Martin.
Turning Points medical Director says restrictions on prescription medication is good but it can have a negative impact on people who are truly addicted.
They may resort to other places to get medications and thats when the issue comes of them possibly having an increased chance of an overdose says Dr. Kallol Saha.
Youre gonna turn to wherever you can get that often times thats going to the street and get pills heroin whatever it may be. And in todays time with fentanyl these pills its like playing Russian roulette with your life you never know what that could be says Martin.
Addiction specialists at Turning Point say education is key. People who are prescribed pain pills need to know how to taper themselves off safely and effectively.
The government shutdown is also affecting those struggling with an opioid addiction.
Dr. Saha says the shutdown could be a life or death situation for addicts seeking help because doctors must be certified to prescribe the medication used to treat people addicted to opioids. That medication could soon be hard to get.
MEMPHIS Tenn. WMC - Mid-South first responders law enforcement officers and health officials have answered calls to more than 2600 suspected drug overdoses in Shelby County since the beginning of the year.
Now a new approach to ending overdoses targets areas where they happen the most.
At 45 John Marino likes to spend time with his granddaughter but a majority of Marino's life was spent on a different path.
It wasnt even living. You just exist. Thats to the point I got. I just existed said Marino.
Until four years ago Marino was a drug addict. Cocaine as a teen. Opioids once he got older.
Mug shots document his path of self-destruction.
Id have to wake up and eat 10 10 mg Valiums. Most people couldnt function. That was just to be OK said Marino.
He spent years in and out of institutions rehab centers and jail.
Marino lost jobs destroyed relationships and became homeless.
Youre OK with whats going on. You think thats the normal. Thats the norm because everybody youre around is like that because thats who you surround yourself with said Marino.
On two separate occasions Marino almost died from drug overdoses. Nalaxone a narcotic used to treat overdoses in emergencies saved his life.
Hes one of the lucky ones.
Theres really no community thats spared in Shelby County. That all races are impacted. Both genders are impacted and the age groups vary widely said Dr. Alisa Hausehalter director of the Shelby County Health Department.
Data obtained from the Shelby County Health Department shows 164 deaths related to suspected drug overdose in 2017. The following year records show a 30 increase in overdose deaths.
In just the first nine months of this year health officials attributed 227 deaths in Shelby County to suspected drug overdoses.
Now a new tool can track overdoses the ones that result in death and those that dont. It provides health professionals and law enforcement invaluable data to fight the opioid epidemic in real time.
Its called an Overdose Map or OD Map and Shelby County is the first in the state to use it.
We receive data from the City of Memphis as well as the other six municipalities from their fire primarily ambulance service. In some cases it could be police said Hausehalter.
Heres how it works Data gets entered into OD MAP and points get plotted on a map with information like whether Naloxone was administered and the time of day the call for help came in.
It allows us to figure out where the criminal activity happening when its happening and then getting resources in there to prevent the next death said Shelby County District Attorney Amy Weirich.
This map displays the rate of reported drug overdose events in Shelby County by zip code from January through October of 2019. Rates are based on ACS 2017 5-year population estimates. Data displayed in this map is provisional and subject to change. Shelby County Health Department Shelby County Health Department
Using this data the health department created heat maps to show the hardest hit areas in Shelby County. Zip codes with the highest number of overdose events from January to October of 2019 include 38109 which encompasses Southwest Memphis and parts of Whitehaven.
OD Map shows 198 incidents there over the past 10 months 168 incidents in 38118 the Parkway Village area and 38104 which includes Midtown Central Gardens and Cooper-Young.
The Frayser zip code 38127 saw 156 suspected overdoses while the Berclair High Point Terrace Grahamwood and The Heights zip code recorded 152 incidents.
What we know about their pattern and their habits is that they typically use almost immediately where they're purchasing so the drug transaction is occurring and then the overdose is occurring very quickly right after that in that location said U.S. Attorney Mike Dunavant.
Having exact addresses helps law enforcement agencies not only target areas for prosecution but also intervention.
It requires education and awareness. It requires prevention. It requires treatment and then of course enforcement said Dunavant.
Its a high-tech treatment plan to prevent the overdose next door and give more people like John Marino a fighting chance.

It wasn't long ago that patients arriving at the emergency department of Baptist Memorial Hospital-Memphis with bone fractures migraines and other maladies could count on getting potent opioid medication to alleviate their pain.
Not anymore.
Amid a deadly epidemic of opioid addiction gripping the nation Baptist's emergency department is charting a new course in treating pain. Instead of turning first to such drugs as morphine or oxycodone ER doctors and nurse practitioners operate under a new protocol emphasizing the use when appropriate of non-addictive alternatives like intravenous acetaminophen lidocaine patches muscle relaxers and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication.
It's a program Baptist calls Opioid Light and so far it's yielding major benefits hospital officials say.
COMPLETE COVERAGE The science of opioids
Since its launch in March the number of ER patients receiving opioids has dropped by 50 percent while the total number of milligrams prescribed is down 58 percent. At the same time patient satisfaction with the treatment of their pain has risen 30 percent according to the hospital.
We just had to change our culture said Julie Bennett critical staff pharmacist at Baptist Memphis.
MoreShelby County unveils strategy for opioid crisis response
Baptist isn't alone among Memphis-area hospitals in working to rein in the use of opioids.
Regional Medical Center is collecting data to guide the possible development of a similar program spokeswoman Angie Golding said. Also Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare has created a policy that reduces the number of days for which emergency department physicians will prescribe opioids the company said in a prepared statement.
If our medical professionals suspect patients may need help with an addiction we work closely with mental health facilities that offer programs that they could benefit from and improve their mental health the statement continued.
The need for the programs is readily apparent proponents say. Opioid addiction has become so rampant that President Donald Trump last fall declared it a public health emergency. In Tennessee where overdoses claim at least three lives a day Gov. Bill Haslam last week announced a 30 million plan to fight the opioid addiction problem.
In January TennCare the state's Medicaid program further tightened its limits on the amount of opioid medication that participants can be prescribed.
In addition to morphine and oxycodone the opioids most typically tied to addiction include fentanyl hydrocodone and Percocet. Many patients who become hooked on the prescription drugs turn to heroin after being unable to get further prescriptions.
The Memphis area so far has been spared the worst of the epidemic. Opioid prescriptions in Shelby County totaled 73.6 per 100 people during 2016 less than half the rates at which the painkillers were dispensed in many other Tennessee counties according to data collected by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Still the problem is significant here said Dr. Marilyn McLeod medical director of the emergency department at Baptist Memphis.
It's not an unusual day when two or three people are dropped off in the ED not breathing because of an opioid overdose she said.
Opioids became pervasive in part because doctors saw them as the best means to get patients' pain under control McLeod said. And in many cases the reimbursements physicians received were based in part on patient satisfaction with their pain management.
Many doctors also believed  wrongly as it turns out  that if patients were truly in pain when they took opioids they wouldn't get addicted she said.
We thought we were doing the right thing McLeod said.
What has become abundantly clear is that the problem of opioid addiction breaches all demographics regardless of income and education levels.
Anybody could get pain medicine for a few days and turn into an addict McLeod said.
To help head off addiction Baptist began educating emergency department doctors and nurse practitioners on alternatives to opioids some of which are more effective in managing pain.
Although it's the source of only a small percentage of prescriptions at the hospital the emergency department is key because it's where patients often get their first medications McLeod said.
The staff developed a list of alternatives to opioids that could be used depending on a patient's diagnosis. McLeod emphasizes there are many ailments and injuries that still will require opioids.
If you come in here and you have stage IV cancer you're going to get opioids for your pain she said.
The cases in which non-opioid alternatives are most likely to be used include fractures abdominal pain muscular and skeletal pain renal cholic and migraines McLeod said.
In cases in which opioids are prescribed emergency room doctors often are prescribing fewer days' worth of pills. Instead of the seven-day supply formerly provided less than three days' worth is typical now.
In addition to reducing the number of patients getting opioids and the doses prescribed the Opioid Light program also seeks to reset patients' expectations about pain management hospital officials say.
Sometimes the best thing for a patient is not what they want McLeod said. Switching to alternatives is more work but it's the right thing to do.
Still amid the growing awareness of the addiction problem more and more patients are asking that they not be given opioids Bennett and McLeod say.
Once results from the program are fully measured the initiative could expand to other departments of the hospital McLeod said. Preventing addiction among patients is paramount.
Once they get addicted we're behind the eight ball she said.

The nations first center of excellence in addiction medicine was unveiled in Memphis on Tuesday to help physicians rise to the challenge of treating substance abuse including the opioid epidemic.
The Center for Addiction Science at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center College of Medicine is the first to receive the center of excellence recognition from The Addiction Medicine Foundation based in Bethesda Maryland.
The foundation accredits physician training in addiction medicine. As the first center of excellence in addiction medicine the Memphis-based UT College of Medicines Center for Addiction Science will serve as a model for centers that combine treatment research education for health professionals and community outreach officials said.
Dr. Kevin Kunz executive vice president of The Addiction Medicine Foundation praised the collaboration and community support at UTHSC. Resistance to change and silo-like departments that don't work together in medical schools are obstacles to meeting the addiction challenge Kunz said.
It surprises most people that across the United States one out of every 100 deaths today across America is due directly to an opioid overdose a prescription pain pill that was diverted or taken inappropriately he told an audience in Downtown Memphis.
Or to heroin and 75 percent of today's heroin users in America started with prescription pain pills written by a physician that was then either used by that patient or diverted from mom's medicine cabinet Kunz said.
For Dr. David Stern Robert Kaplan executive dean of the UT College of Medicine the Center for Addiction Science is the latest example of harnessing the UT Health Science Center to meet health needs in Memphis and the region.
Yes we train students but not in a vacuum Stern said. The goal is to have an impact in a positive way whether it's treating patients with addictive disorders training fellows...or the researchers that are looking at how can we use particularly gene environment interactions to understand how do we better treat the patients how do we identify vulnerable patients how can we make a difference
Dr. Daniel Sumrok director of the Center for Addiction Science called addiction an equal-opportunity illness that does not discriminate.
The picture of addiction is much different now than it was even a decade ago Sumrok said in a statement. Anyone can become addicted to painkillers and we are doing our part to reduce the dependency rate.
Abuse opioids prescription painkillers have become a national epidemic that also fuel a rise in heroin addiction authorities say.
Memphis police have investigated more than 220 heroin overdoses so far this year with 77 deaths federal and state prosecutors say.In Tennessee more than 1263 people died from opioid overdoses in 2014 officials said citing state Health Department and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.
More broadly harmful effects of addictions including alcohol and nicotine are the leading cause of death in Tennessee and account for about one in four deaths nationwide officials said.
Training doctors to offer pain therapy alternatives to avoid over-prescription of opioids is one goal of the center. Increasing the number of physicians equipped to treat addictions like a chronic disease is another.
The Center for Addiction Science offers a new addiction fellowship to train doctors and other health care professionals in preventing diagnosing and treating addiction. Multidisciplinary research includes a special focus on newborns exposed to addictive drugs before they are born.
Stern Kunz and Methodist University Hospital CEO Jeffrey Liebman provided an overview of the effort at an Oct. 25 White House symposium called Medicine Responds to Addiction II. A video including their remarks is available at whitehouse.gov.

MEMPHIS Tenn  The Shelby County Health Department is on a mission to combat opioid overdoses and fentanyl deaths in the Mid-South.
In partnership with the Tennessee Department of health the SCHD is giving out free opioid overdose harm reduction kits while supplies last.
From 2018 to 2020 overdoses killed more people in Shelby County than automobile accidents said Dr. Michelle Taylor Shelby County Health Department Director-Health Officer in a news release.
Health experts say the risk of someone accidentally overdosing increases because of synthetic opioids like fentanyl which is the most common drug in overdose deaths. Its often added unknowingly for the user to other street drugs and pills sold on the streets and can look identical to prescription opioids.
The kits contain two doses of naloxone nasal spray and 10 fentanyl test strips with instructions.
Almost anyone can administer naloxone. It saves the lives of people who have overdosed on opioids and does not harm people who are not experiencing an overdose. I strongly encourage everyone to keep a harm reduction kit if needed said Dr. Taylor.
The kits are available on a first come first served basis from 8 a.m. to 430 p.m. at Shelby County Health Department locations listed below

The Local I-Team digs into the Mid-Souths growing heroin problem.
So far this year 29 people have died from heroin overdoses in Memphis and Shelby County.
Memphis police have created a special task force to investigate all the heroin overdose deaths.
Senior investigator Jeni Diprizio sat down with a Cordova man who says he used heroin for years and explains why the drug is so addictive and deadly.
People whove used heroin say the drug made them feel warm blissful and happy. They say it feels like youre being cradled asleep by God.
You never think it can happen to you said Austin Carroll.
Carroll is a former heroin addict.
Youre always chasing that initial high explained Carroll.
Like many heroin users Carroll first got addicted to pain pills. In his case after hurting his foot.
Eventually my pain pill tolerance was crazy said Carroll. I got to the point before I started shooting up I was eating 60 pain pills a day.
When that got too expensive Carroll switched to heroin. Its a common story. Heroin is cheaper and easier to find than prescription pain pills.
Carroll says most heroin addicts want to stop but when they do they get so sick they cant.
You get to the point where you just hate it said Carroll.
A lot of the overdoses we are seeing are people who have been through rehab havent done heroin in a while and now they died their first or second time back explained Assistant District Attorney Paul Hagerman.
Prosecutors say another reason people are dying is because dealers often mix or cut their heroin with another drug called fentanyl a strong pain killer.
Fentanyl is incredibly more powerful. 100 times more powerful than morphine said Hagerman.
The amount of fentanyl the drug dealers dont even know they are using a deadly amount. And its leading to the overdoses said MPD Col. Mitchell Hardy.
Liz Carroll is married to Austin. She says several of their friends have overdosed on heroin.
After someone overdoses the dealer actually sells out. His clients hear someone ODd and that means he has the good stuff. That means his stuff is strong and so he sells out said Carroll.
Austin Carroll says its been eight years since he last used heroin and hes glad he was finally was able to break away.

More than 52000 overdose deaths nationwide in 2015 more than 33000 of them from opioids. It's the equivalent of 91 deaths per day one every 16 minutes -- the same as one 747 airliner crash every 4.5 days assuming the average 416 passengers carried by a 747.
That's unreal isn't it when you think of it that way says Tammy Reynolds an agent with the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics.
But it is real Reynolds and a team of state and local representatives conceded Tuesday evening. They came to Landers Center in Southaven for what was dubbed a Town Hall Rally to discuss the state's ongoing opioid drug epidemic. The stop was part of series of statewide meetings that will continue into December.

The meetings sponsored by a coalition of state agencies in conjunction with the federal Drug Enforcement Administration and FBI underscores the fact that the national numbers are equally grim in Mississippi where heroin-related overdoses rose 2000 percent from 2013 to 2016. DeSoto County leads the state in heroin deaths with 23 last year and 19 already this year.
More than 100 came to the Southaven gathering many from Memphis and surrounding areas. Those in attendance were a mix of law enforcement and health care professionals recovering addicts and families desperately seeking answers that everyone admitted they didn't have.
We want to bring some hope some thinking some ideas to the table said Steve Parker deputy director of the Mississippi Board of Pharmacy.
Reynolds said the problem cuts across the social spectrum and overcoming the stigma of drug abuse and working together are pieces of the answer.
There are parents today who are losing sons and daughters there are pregnant women who are shooting up heroin and overdosing she said. We have grandparents in epidemic proportions who are raising grandchildren even great-grandchildren.
So we're coming together today with you guys because we don't have all the answers. Law enforcement doesn't the Department of Mental Health doesn't providers who issue prescription drugs don't. We hope by enlightening you to what we're seeing we can all work together to find solutions.

The stories shared during the two-hour exchange were a brutal assault on the senses -- a desperate father speaking in a broken voice about driving his son to Murfreesboro Tennessee for treatment just to get him away from his daily influences closer to home and a family whose child overdosed while waiting to get into treatment only to be released from the hospital directly into a treatment facility before he could use again.
And then there was Debra Ward sitting on the front row and holding close a photo of her daughter who died a year ago at 20 years old. She died from a heart valve infection she got from using a dirty needle to inject heroin. Ward held on her lap an 8-by-10 photo of her smiling daughter and granddaughter.
At least I was left with a little piece of her Ward said referring to the granddaughter now in her custody.

Panelists who could often only offer their sympathy said reducing the number of opioids prescribed is part of the solution. Prescription pills often fall into the wrong hands and lead to addiction and ultimately heroin use since they said heroin offers the same high at a lower price.
Statistics cited by Reynolds show the U.S. which accounts for about 5 percent of the world's population consumes about 80 percent of the opioids manufactured worldwide. The percentage includes 99.7 percent of all hydrocodone products.
Making naloxone a medication designed to block and reverse opioid effects more accessible was identified as another part of the solution.
One tool that can't be considered a solution all agreed is criminalizing drug addiction. Though DeSoto County Sheriff Bill Rasco called addiction an epidemic we have to get under control Reynolds the Bureau of Narcotics agent agent said what all were thinking
We cannot Reynolds emphasized arrest our way out of this.
The next Town Hall Rally is scheduled for Aug. 15 in Columbus. An Oct. 3 rally is set for Oxford.

Life After Addiction
After video of their overdose went viral a couple got a chance at redemption
Story by Alice Park  Photographs by Jeffrey Stockbridge for TIME
The video is hard to watch. A middle-aged man is bent backward over a bus-stop bench eyes closed head brushing the ground and a cell phone in his outstretched hand. It rings but the man doesnt move. A few feet away dangerously close to the road a woman lies facedown on the sidewalk her legs buckled under her. She tries to get up but cant make it and collapses back down in a heap.
The pair are in whats known as the medical district of Memphis near a major academic hospital but people walk by without a second glance. Others take out their phones and start recording. Look they on the good gas man says one of the people who streamed the scene to Facebook Live. Another starts an impromptu rap Percocet she pop a Percocet she on the Xanax.
The footage quickly went viral and was viewed millions of times.
The man in the video is named Ron Hiers and the woman is his wife Carla. They had just picked up heroin and too impatient to wait until they got home walked into the bathroom of a nearby Walgreens and shot up. Then they headed for the bus stop and passed out.
It took a dose of naloxonea drug that paramedics emergency medical technicians and even law-enforcement officers have started carrying for the ballooning number of narcotic overdoses they seeto revive Ron and Carla. They were taken to the hospital and then police took Carla to jail for outstanding charges of petty theft. Ron found his way back home.
I felt sorry for her Ron says in his first extended interview almost one year after the video was shot. But I also thought Theres more for me. Ron says he injected Carlas portion of the heroin and then took what was left of his monthly prescription of Xanax pills about four dozen of them hoping they would put an end to more than four decades of pain and addiction. They almost did.
Thats what drugs and alcohol will do to you. Itll take you places you cant imagine.
The video of Ron and Carlas overdose is part of a grim genre that has emerged alongside the deadliest drug crisis in American history. Every day across the country nearly 100 people die from overdoses of opioids powerful narcotic painkillers that attach to cells and dull pain slow breathing and bring on an overall sense of calm and satisfaction. Since 1999 the rate of fatal prescription opioid overdoses in the U.S. has quadrupled. In 2015 drug overdoses claimed more lives than car accidents and gun violence and rivaled the HIVAIDS crisis at its peak. The toll as the White House commission on the crisis put it is the equivalent of the 911 attacks every three weeks.
It is an epidemic without boundaries touching every corner of the nation every income group and virtually every age including a baby born in opioid withdrawal every 25 minutes. In a September study on mortality in the U.S. researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC found that opioids contributed to a decline in the life expectancy of Americans from 2000 to 2015. Indeed in some parts of the country bodies pile up so quickly that medical examiners have resorted to storing the overflow in makeshift freezers when their morgues are full. In big cities and small towns alike police officers are responding to more and more overdose calls limiting their ability to address other crimes.
Even many firefighters now are expected to use naloxone and are being called out to revive addicts who overdose so frequently they know them by name.
In response to the growing crisis President Trump declared a national public-health emergency on Oct. 26 which means federal agencies have 90 days to redirect existing resources to fighting the epidemic. It was a broad call to action but one that failed to allocate much-needed new funding to address the crisis. The Presidents Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis which issued its final recommendations days after the Presidents declaration also stopped short of providing more dollars for the epidemic while calling for measures such as tightening regulations on opioid prescriptions expanding the use of drug courts as an alternative to incarceration and enhancing access to addiction treatments and overdose medications like naloxone.
As the epidemic has worsened its become clear that existing strategies and resources arent sufficient. Many states already restrict how much opioids doctors can prescribe and the Food and Drug Administration FDA took the unprecedented step last summer to pull from the market medications for which the addictive dangers outweigh the painkilling benefits. The agency along with the CDC is pushing for changes in the way opioids are prescribed including limiting the number of pills doctors can prescribe at one time and restricting the conditions for which opioids can be dispensed. Pharmacies are also addressing the crisis CVS announced this fall that it will only reimburse its beneficiaries for seven days of a prescription and will only dispense short-acting opioids and not long-acting versions to first-time users. And last month Walgreens announced it will start selling the overdose-reversal drug Narcan over the countera move that can be seen as an acknowledgment of just how widespread the problem has become.
These efforts however have had unintended consequences. Restricting access to legal opioids has led to an explosion of illegal substitutes that have similar narcotic effects. Drugs such as heroin fentanyl carfentanil and U-47700 are cheaper and in many cases more harmful than legal opioids because they are synthetic formulations with no FDA standards for safety and quality control.
From 2002 to 2015 deaths from heroin overdose increased more than sixfold and in 2016 the Drug Enforcement Administration DEA reported more than 30000 seizures of fentanyl a dramatic spike from the 5000 documented in 2014. The man-made formulas are so powerful that police officers participating in drug raids where fentanyl is confiscated have overdosed simply by breathing in particles of the drug released into the air. The opioid epidemic may have been sparked by prescription medications but its now as much a label for a much larger addiction crisis in the U.S. spanning dozens of drugs both legal and not.
The toll has been evident in Memphis where Ron and Carla overdosed on that sunny fall day. Between 2010 and 2015 deaths from drug overdoses increased by 40. But statistics can seem like abstractions numbers to be glossed over rather than felt as actual loss.
Understanding how this crisis is upending lives devastating families and changing communities requires hearing the stories of those with the most at stake. On Oct. 3 2016 Ron and Carla Hiers became an official part of the grim record their overdoses added to the several hundred tallied in the city that year and to the tens of thousands documented for the country. Thats what drugs and alcohol will do to you says Ron. Itll take you places you cant imagine.
This is their story.
I cant say that I really ever thought that I had a drug problem.
Ron Hiers was born in Memphis in 1955 with a cleft palate. Surgery corrected the birth defect but left him with a nasal twang that became a target of his classmates ridicule. He says he was bullied throughout school and had a knack for finding trouble. He was expelled from high school after a series of incidents including threatening a teacher and began drifting across the South working construction to stay afloat.

After he fell during a construction job and broke his heel prescriptions for opioids like the pain reliever oxycodone became relatively easy to come by. Even after the bone had healed Ron found a way to make it seem like the pain had returnedover and over again. They can take an X-ray but they dont know whether it bothers you or not so I could always keep the pain meds going he says.
When Ron couldnt get his hands on opioids he turned to heroin which had the same narcotic effect and was less expensive and often less of a hassle to obtain. It was about as easy to find drugs as finding your shoe to put on in the morning he says.
It was during a visit back home in Memphis after Ron called one of his regular dealers to supply drugs for a party that he met his wife Carla. They quickly bonded over their shared addiction. I dont remember Ron proposing because I was always medicated Carla 61 says today more than 20 years after they first met.
Like Ron Carla says she began using drugs in high school mostly to fit in and found she loved the way opioids made her feel. Its a euphoric high everything is O.K. with the world and you just feel great she says. But as the years went on the using got more intense and it got to the point where I had to keep using because I was addicted to it and if I didnt use I would get sick.
Addiction is at its essence a hijacking. Parts of the brain that are dedicated to rewarding behavior and triggering feelings of satisfaction and calm are kidnapped by opioid drugs to induce a temporary state of ease and even euphoria. The impulsive reward-driven system of the brain goes into overdrive says Dr. Sarah Wakeman director of the substance-use disorder initiative at Massachusetts General Hospital.
Opioids are particularly adept at such snatching and seizing. The body has its own SWAT team that swoops in when pain erupts receptors on nearly every cell in the body are primed to sound the alarm when you say put your hand on a hot stove or stub your toe. Opioid receptors populate cells not just in the body but in the brain and spinal cord as well. Their job is to tone down the firing pain signalsthe fast breathing the feeling of panic and the excruciating feeling of ouchas quickly as possible. Opioid drugs target these receptors and magnify the bodys natural painkilling response. For people with long-term chronic pain that can be essential to getting through the day. But the receptors are also intimately networked with the pleasure and reward areas of the brain. They are supposed to counteract the unpleasant feeling of pain with the opposite sensation. The catch is that for people already at risk for addiction once the brain and body get a taste of the pleasure override they want more.
Neurologists now know that drugs like opioids can change the brain in people who develop addiction. Once the opioid receptors are activated in these vulnerable brains they stay activated becoming the brains bully demanding all of the energy and all of the attention. The reward-oriented brain the regions responsible for impulses and emotions take precedence over the thinking parts that evaluate things like risk benefit consequences and delayed gratification.
And because opioids can release more dopamine the feel-good sensations triggered by the drug overpower any positive feelings from things like food love and even sex. Opioids causes a higher rush of dopamine to the brain that cues the mind to pay attention to that says Wakeman.
Thats how opioid drugs become so addictive they suppress pain with impressive efficiency but they also prime neurons to seek and stay in that state of pain-free bliss. It takes you to a state of nirvana says Ron. I can describe it best by saying that if you and your wife are in a house and your wife runs in the room and says I just ran over the dog your response is Well get another one. Nothing matters. Absolutely nothing. Theres nothing you can say to me that can get me upset or alarmed. It buries your feelings so deep. In pursuit of that feeling Ron and Carla took to forging prescriptions. They described their routine as if it were scripted the pair would visit a hospital and Ron would pose as the patient signing in with a made up name and Social Security number and spin a yarn about a toothache. He asked for antibiotics not painkillers. That would throw the doctor on easy street because Im not in there asking for something for pain like he generally hears says Ron.
Eventually a sympathetic doctor would ask if he were also in pain and prescribe an opioid. It didnt matter which drug he prescribed or how many pills. What Ron and Carla really wanted was his DEA number which is required for filling any prescription medication. While Ron was seeing the doctor Carla would scope the nurses station for the other critical part of their scheme unattended prescription pads.
Carla got pregnant in 1995 and the couple used the doctors visits as a way to fuel their addiction. While in the hospital the Hiers managed to steal more prescription pads before urine and blood tests revealed Carlas opioid abuse.
The hospital called Child Protective Services but their daughter was born with a congenital heart defect that required her to be airlifted to a specialized childrens hospital. After a court case they say they ultimately gave up custody to a family that adopted their daughter as an infant.
Even being deemed incapable of keeping their child wasnt enough to jolt Ron and Carla to sobriety. I cant say that I really ever thought that I had a drug problem says Ron. Your addiction dont let you think like that. Your addiction wants you to think that Man this is fine. Youre doing O.K. This is normal this is the way to live life. Youre not doing nothing wrong.
Ron had three children before he married Carla and while he has reached out to all of them since he became sober not all of them have welcomed him into their lives. He says that the daughter he had with Carla does not want a relationship with him. And he doesnt blame her. He recalls coming home with his first child to a ransacked house and a warrant stuck to the door for drug possession. When his second child was born he says he left his wife while she was in labor to visit a strip club across the street from the hospital. He wasnt even aware he had a third child until a teenaged boy called him and told him he was his son and asked to meet. Ron says he gave his son Xanax before sending him back home.
No decisions that you make on drugs or alcohol are right none.
Paris Hardee was one of the millions of people who watched the video of Ron and Carlas overdose. It was her birthday and she was on her way to a celebratory dinner when a relative called to say that her father had been on the news. She Googled the video and saw Ron sprawled across the bus stop. Paris wasnt surprised by what she saw. I made fun of him like everybody else she says. I was like Theres Rons 15 minutes of fame.

Paris 35 is Rons second child with his first wife. She was raised by Rons parents when he proved too unreliable. She only remembers her father when he was high always asking her and his parents for money.
When she was around 8 Paris says Ron was arrested in front of her and her friends. We lost all of our friends she says. Nobodys parents would let us play with them after that and we had to move. Thats really hard when youre in the third grade. I lost every friend I had but I still thought he was a good guy.
Rons parents worked hard to maintain their granddaughters perception. They bought and wrapped birthday and Christmas presents for Paris and her sister in their fathers name and never openly discussed his problems. Still Paris couldnt help but worry about her dad particularly when he called her from jail. I was scared for him she says. I thought somebody would beat him up and when I went to bed I would worry about him a lot.
For a while Paris tried to help. She wrote motivational notes on pieces of paper that she would stick in his wallet hoping they would remind him to not drink.
It was like Dad you can do it. I love you and youre strong. Just these little pieces of paper that I wanted him to pull out and read she says.
Her father repaid her by stealing the birthday money and allowance she got from his parents. He was always going to choose drugs over health over family over friendships Paris says. He was going to choose drugs no matter what.
Paris cut off contact with her father keeping him out of her life for 13 years including her college graduation and her wedding. She started referring to him as Ron rather than Dad.
That changed once she saw the overdose video. She couldnt shake the image of her father splayed across the bench limp and unconscious. After pushing him out of her mind for more than a decade she now couldnt stop thinking about the father who had never really been one.
The clip that had aired on the local news contained the number for Addiction Campuses a for-profit drug-addiction recovery company with four locations around the country. Paris dialed. I was crying and I said to whoever answered The man who ODd in Memphisthats my dad.
Addicts can say anything addicts are great actors you know.
On the other end of the line the dispatcher for Addiction Campuses called Stacy Dodd director of operations for their facility just over the Tennessee border in Mississippi. A former addict Dodd saw an opportunity to help Ron and help the center. He offered to bring Ron in for a 30-day treatment program and waive the typical fee which can run up to 25000.
Ron may have been at rock bottom but he wasnt yet ready to look up. Several months before his overdose Ron was diagnosed with tonsillar cancer. He says he continued to get high during his chemotherapy treatments which he completed in July 2016 according to his medical records snorting before and after his appointments.
On the first day of every month Ron filled a prescription for Xanax that his doctor had written to help with his anxiety. There were nearly four dozen pills left in the bottle and he says on Oct. 3 2016 after being revived from the overdose that millions witnessed online he took them all.
Id like to have died from the cancer Ron says. I was tired. I was sick of living. I got tired of waking up. I got tired of putting my shoes on. I got tired of reaching for my syringe. I got tired of going and getting money for dope and I knew I just couldnt live without dope. It wasnt a new feeling for Ron. In his wallet he carried a weathered scrap of paper on which he had scrawled his own obituary. He left the date of his death blank.
Like many recovery and rehabilitation facilities Turning Point an Addiction Campuses facility relies on a combination of medications and behavior therapy to help people overcome their addiction. Medication-assisted treatment or MAT involves using another opioid such as buprenorphine to gradually withdraw an opioid addict from his dependence on the drugs. Unlike methadone which is also used to treat opioid addiction physicians can prescribe it without the need for a rigid clinical program for monitoring the recovering addict. Its less likely to trigger the addiction and reward cycles that morphine and opioid drugs do but its use is controversial. Law-enforcement officers in particular have been skeptical of buprenorphines usefulness worrying that it amounts to replacing one drug for another in an addicts downward spiral.
Many doctors on the other hand see MAT as an essential part of stopping the addiction cycle a way to break the brains relentless search for more opioids. The goal of medication is to relieve that mental obsession the feelings of craving says Wakeman who believes MAT is the best way to help addicts on the road to sobriety. We need to get people stabilized and restore their brain to normal function so they are able to think normally.
When Ron woke up on his first morning at the center he wasnt sold on the idea of recovery. My first thought was to get out of this damn place and get on back to that boardinghouse he says. But when the elevator doors opened in the lobby he saw that the center was coed. Im not trying to be funny. Thats what my mind actually thought there were good-looking girls there so I was not leaving.
However shallow his reason for staying Ron did. One day turned into two and eventually he completed the 30-day program. The therapy included learning skills to help him and his fellow addicts divert their urge to act out of emotion which often leads to reckless and compulsive behavior like drug use that ends up with their harming themselves or others and instead to adopt skills to control and turn those emotions and urges into positive reactions rather than negative ones.
After a few weeks in jail Carla was released and called Paris looking for Ron. Paris told her he was in a recovery program and Carla too reached out and was offered a similar arrangement as Ron but at the companys facility in Massachusetts. Because they had used together the center thought they needed to recover separately. I had to relearn my thinking I had to relearn my dealings with people and to listen to people Carla says of entering treatment.
Undoing decades of addiction is an ongoing process. For the first few weeks at the center Ron was telling the counselors what he thought they wanted to hear. Addicts can say anything addicts are great actors you know he says.
Across the country opioid rehabilitation has become a big businessclaiming a larger chunk of the 35 billion drug-addiction treatment industry every year.
Recovery facilities typically provide 30-day programs since thats what insurance plans tend to cover. Its enough time to wash the drugs out of the addicts system but often not enough to arm them with the deeper skills they need to confront the forces that drove them to use in the first place. Relapse rates are highaddiction doctors say nearly every addict who enters treatment can expect to relapse.
Some recovery programs exacerbate the problem by treating addiction as an acute problem that can be solved with a one-time solution rather than an ongoing disease. A rise in such programs has led the FBI to investigate centers that defraud addicts and their insurers allegedly billing for services that arent always effective and can set off a cycle of expensive recovery and relapse.
What recovery facilities do provide however is a forced period during which opioids are flushed out of the body and for some thats enough to expose some hard truths. It was for Ron. After nearly a month of sober living Ron says he woke up one morning and asked himself two questions Are you honestly happy Do you want to kill yourself I couldnt answer the first with a yes because I had an obituary in my freakin wallet he says. But I also realized I honestly no longer wanted to kill myself.
That marked a change for Ron. Thats when the skills the counselors were trying to teach him and the perspective they were hoping he would gain about his life and his relationships became more than an exercise to fill up the day. Gradually Ron began to see his life for what it wasa squandered opportunity a collection of people he hurt and abandoned a series of delusions. Were scared to death of being found out he says of clinging to drugs. I was most afraid of finding out who I was because I never knew. I was scared to find out. I was scared to find out that I was probably not as tough as I thought I was. I was probably not as handsome as I thought I was. I was probably not as well-liked as I thought I was. I was scared to discover the truth about me.
After a month in treatment Rons first phone call came from Paris. She begged him to stay longer to continue working on his recovery. She knew that 48 years of addiction couldnt be wiped away in a month so she made him promise to stay.
He promised. It was the first promise he made to anyone that he kept in a long long time.
I wouldnt trade any day of recovery that Ive had for a day of addiction.
Ron still has that cell phone that rings in the video. He still has the numbers of his dope boys the dealers who with a push of a button would send him right back to the drug-fueled nirvana that sustained him for nearly half a century. He also has a new cell phone with new contacts for people who have reached out since hes been in recovery. But he keeps that old phone and its numbers as a reminder. I dont never want to forget where I came from he says. If I forget that I could go back.
After more than a month at the recovery center Ron moved into a halfway house. He now shares an apartment with people he met during recovery. There his new talismanreplacing the 40 oz. bottle of beer that he says was part of my outfit for decadesis a blue Alcoholics Anonymous book filled with his notes in the margins.
Paris whose phone call may well have saved her fathers life has gradually let him back into her world and introduced him to his grandchildren. Not long ago Ron texted Paris at 2 a.m. seized with regret. I just now wept with sorrow having finally realized how much I wouldev sic enjoyed loving my children their entire life sic he wrote. He didnt expect an answer but the next morning Paris replied. Dont cry Dad. I was really awkward until about 27. You didnt miss much. I love you so so much.
She is cautious however since he has been high for nearly 50 years and sober for just one. I am part of his support system but I have boundaries and I have to maintain those boundaries for my self Paris says.
Ron still considers getting high every once in a while. But now his thinking brain takes over and quells the urge that rises from the deeper baser brain that is ruled by the mission to feel good at all costs. And that say addiction experts is how recovery starts. For all the ways opioids can rewire the brain it can be reversed when the hijacked pleasure networks are freed from the onslaught of drugs.
Close to the first anniversary of Rons sobriety Paris is amazed by his transformation. I have my father back she says in a text message. It is true that my childhood was rough but now Im blessed with a father who is growing and changing every day. Someone who did not know how to show love to himself or others is now through Gods grace experiencing and giving love for the first time. Thats a miracle
Carla too lives on her own but in an apartment in Massachusetts far from her old haunts. Raised as a Southern Baptist Carla rediscovered her faith and says shes committed to building a new life. She continues to go to meetings and shares her story of recovery with others who are struggling with addiction. I dont want to go back to Memphis. A lot of bad memories a lot of bad things happened there she says. Ron and Carla talk on the phone and over social media but they havent seen each other since their overdose. Both say they realize they are different people now and that the things that bound them together before are no longer a part of their lives.
Ron is hoping to become a recovery counselor helping people like himself by his example. Life shouldnt be taken lightly he says. Its a gracious gift meant to enjoy and not be squandered. Ive come to the realization that Ive wasted mineyou only get one and I wasted it. Its a hard-won lesson but one that is helping him to make the most of whatever life he has left. I wouldnt trade any day of recovery that Ive had for a day of addiction since Ive sobered up he says. The best thing I have now is peace. With reporting by Paul MoakleyMemphis

The capacity for treating opioid addiction is less than demand.
Laura Berlind is executive director of The Sycamore Institute based in Nashville.
The opioid epidemic has had a staggering impact in Tennessee countless loved ones gone higher health care costs more drug-related crime reduced work productivity more children in state custody and a 10-fold increase in babies born with symptoms of opioid withdrawal.
To date Tennessees response has largely focused on curbing the abuse of prescription painkillers. In 2012 we had an average of 1.4 opioid prescriptions for every Tennessean  the second highest rate in the country. Among other steps Tennessee now requires greater use of its controlled substance monitoring database regulates pain management clinics and has issued guidelines for prescribers.
These changes have significantly reduced the amount and potency of opioid prescriptions in the state. The number of Tennesseans who report misusing prescription pain relievers has also fallen by nearly a quarter.
But evidence suggests that Tennesseans are increasingly turning to heroin and fentanyl. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid 50 times stronger than heroin. Opioid-related hospitalizations overdose deaths and cases of neonatal abstinence syndrome also continue to rise. An average of 97 Tennesseans died from opioid or heroin-related overdoses every month in 2015 according to official data.
At least part of reversing these trends lies in understanding and addressing a root cause of the opioid epidemic  addiction. Like asthma and diabetes addiction is a chronic relapsing disease that requires long-term care and management. The key difference is that addiction is an illness of the brain.
Research has shown that effectively addressing behavioral health issues like addiction involves four basic elements promote health and well-being prevent substance abuse provide treatment and foster recovery.
Tennessee has programs and policies that fall into each of those four categories. The lions share of new funding has gone to treatment and recovery services which the federal government recently awarded Tennessee 13.8 million to expand.
Even with these additional resources Tennessees capacity for treating opioid addiction is less than demand and out of sync with the geography of the epidemic.
Medication-assisted treatment or MAT a combination of therapy and addiction medications is considered most effective but some counties with high rates of opioid overdose deaths do not have a single MAT provider. Memphis has three of the 12 clinics licensed for methadone treatment the same as the entire state east of Nashville combined. Physicians certified for buprenorphine treatment are more common but fewer than half of all opioid-dependent Tennesseans had ready access to one in 2015 according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.
Tennessees treatment capacity and individuals access to treatment are also influenced by the coverage and payment practices of private insurers TennCare and safety net programs for the uninsured. For example low payment rates for addiction services could make providers less likely to enter this field. In addition if insurance plans do not cover certain addiction services individuals are less likely to use them.
Gov. Bill Haslam and the General Assembly may want to look at emerging and best practices being pursued by other states localities or at the national level.
Many cities and states have taken steps to better target their prevention efforts through greater data sharing and collaboration between law enforcement public health and other officials. The National Governors Association recommends several ways to expand access to medication-assisted treatment such as requiring MAT training for some medical residents and ensuring TennCare covers all approved MAT medications without prior authorization.
Meanwhile federal officials have encouraged Tennessee to seek a Medicaid waiver that allows TennCare to pay for inpatient addiction treatment at facilities with more than 16 beds.
Tennessee has certainly not ignored the rise in opioid and heroin abuse but the epidemic has grown and evolved faster than our response to it.
A comprehensive review of existing and potential steps that involves multiple stakeholders including the public and private entities that pay for prevention and treatment could help policymakers determine the best path forward.

HAYWOOD COUNTY Tenn.  A Texas man and woman were arrested after a drug-sniffing police K9 found 85 pounds of fentanyl hidden in their car on Sunday March 10.
42-year-old Ernesto Ortiz and 25-year-old Maria Munoz were arrested by officers from the West Tennessee Violent Crime and Drug Task Force after a traffic stop that led to agents finding the drugs.
During the stop the Task Force said officers deployed a drug-sniffing police K9 after they suspected there might be drugs in the car. The dog then alerted the agents who found the fentanyl hidden inside fertilizer bags and a tent bag.
Ortiz and Munoz were arrested on charges of delivering a Schedule II controlled substance and are currently held at Haywood County Jail under a 5000000 bond.
The investigation is ongoing.
According to the CDC Fentanyl and other synthetic opioids are the most common drugs in overdose deaths in the U.S. As little as two milligrams are enough to kill someone.
Drug Task Force Director Johnie Carter also shares that Tennessee is the second highest ranking state among the most overdose dates in the United States in 2021.
According to the CDC Tennessee is only behind Kentucky.
To reverse an overdose from opioids Naloxone is an over-the-counter medication that is easy to carry and can be administered without medical training or permission.
In Shelby County the Memphis Area Prevention Coalition MAPC works on prevention efforts to combat substance abuse in the area.
Drug overdoses have risen in some areas during the COVID-19 pandemic less than a year after the Trump administration touted decreases in the nations overdose epidemic.
From Memphis to Milwaukee a range of cities and counties across the country are reporting spikes in fatal and nonfatal overdoses.
Last year Trump administration officials highlighted progress toward curbing the U.S. overdose crisis of the last decade. In January Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data confirmed that the drug overdose death rate fell by 4.6 percent in 2018 after a record-high number of deaths in 2017.
HHS cheers overdose drop but urges states to cap Medicaid

A May 13 report tracking nationwide overdose data with a focus on six unnamed states with the most reliable information found that two of the six states had a statistically significant rise in overdoses since the pandemic began. The report by a part of the federal Office of National Drug Control Policy uses Overdose Data Mapping Application Program surveillance information.
Aliese Alter the ODMAP program manager who works with the WashingtonBaltimore office that produced the report said historical data modeling did not predict the national increase in overdose data submitted since the onset of COVID-19.
Nationally suspected overdose submissions to ODMAP rose nearly 16.6 percent this year based on a 30-day rolling mean comparison of January through April 2019 to the same time frame in 2020.
The raw numbers show an increase of almost 11.4 percent for fatal overdoses and an increase of 18.6 percent for nonfatal overdoses during that time frame.
Alter cautioned that it is too early to draw any sweeping conclusions. She said the group is working to release more regional data this week.
Experts worry about the impact the pandemic will have on the death rate due to drug and alcohol use.
Never did I imagine the nation would be experiencing the coinciding of mental health issues and infectious disease that my training addressed Elinore McCance-Katz the Department of Health and Human Services assistant secretary for mental health and substance use said at a White House cabinet meeting last week.
Before the pandemic about 120000 individuals died from drug overdose and suicide per year said McCance-Katz who is a psychiatrist with a doctorate in infectious disease epidemiology.
How many more lives are we willing to sacrifice in the name of containing the virus she said. Weve worked so hard in states and communities across this country to combat epidemics like the opioids crisis. Why are we willing to forget those efforts now or deem them less important
HHS Secretary Alex Azar in the same meeting said by one estimate the recession from the pandemic will lead to at least an extra 65000 deaths from drug overdose alcohol abuse and suicide over 10 years. He was referring to median data from a report by the Well Being Trust and the Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care released this month.
Concerns around the country
In an interview with CQ Roll Call Sen. Tim Kaine D-Va. said he has already seen the effects in his state. He would like to see more mental health provisions and funding in subsequent COVID-19 legislation.
Hospitals in Virginia are reporting increases in overdoses. And people might be using drugs to self-medicate or ease their tensions that way or people who have a history of substance use disorder who now dont have the group therapy sessions and then they have extra anxiety on top of that. Were seeing an uptick in things like that said Kaine.
He hopes that the numbers will decrease as restrictions are lifted.
As we start to reopen people will be able to re-engage with their social safety net whether thats friends and family or whether thats group therapy sessions or clinic visits. That should help. I think this is going to take a while he said.
Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam a Democrat separately raised concerns.
In Roanoke County dispatchers have responded to twice as many fatal overdoses in the first five months of this year than they did in all of 2019 Northam said in a news conference last week. The Northern Shenandoah Region has also seen a substantial increase in overdoses both fatal and nonfatal compared to the same time last year.
National CDC data is not expected to be available for several months but some local data was already reported.
Milwaukee reported an increase in drug-related deaths according to Sara Schreiber forensic technical director at the Milwaukee County Medical Examiners Office.
Milwaukee has been crunching data between 2019 and 2020 to measure the increases in deaths though not all of the data from so far this year is available yet.
In 2019 the county had 158 confirmed cases throughout the entire year and as of last week the county had almost hit that number already.
This year already we have confirmed 155 to todays date and we have plenty more that are pending where the toxics isnt complete Schreiber said last week. Were already essentially at the number of confirmed cases we had last year and I know we have more to come.
Schreiber said overdose deaths have been rising in general recently but the first half of this year was especially high. She heard similar reports from other Wisconsin counties.
All those extra stressors are there its really the perfect storm for something awful to happen she said.
In Tennessee Shelby County where Memphis is located has seen an increase in both fatal and nonfatal overdoses.
While the COVID-19 crisis is very troubling and challenging for our county we are also still in the middle of an opioid epidemic said Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris noting that opioid overdoses grew dramatically in recent years in both rural areas and cities like Memphis. Unfortunately its getting worse.
For Some in Congress the Opioid Crisis Is Personal
Last week the Shelby County Health Department issued an overdose spike alert for the 33-day period from April 13 to May 15 during which there were 437 suspected overdose events. Of those 68 were fatal.
Prior to that the county reported 58 fatal overdoses from April 7 to May 7 the most in a 30-day period since the health department began tracking this data on Jan. 1 2019.
This spike in fentanyl overdoses is unprecedented said Western Tennessee U.S. Attorney Michael Dunavant.
Local authorities plan a multidisciplinary response through a coalition of county and federal offices.
Franklin County Ohio which includes the state capital of Columbus also reported 50 percent more deaths in the first four months of the year compared with the same period in 2019.
Erie County New York which includes Buffalo recorded 85 fatal drug overdoses in the first four months of the year a sharp increase from 48 over the same time frame in 2019.
Experts caution it is early to know how this will play out and what the long-term effects could be.
The Well Being Trust analysis that Azar mentioned last week outlines nine possible scenarios leading to additional deaths from drugs alcohol and suicide. Depending on which outcome occurs extra deaths could range from 27644 to 154037 over the next decade with 75000 additional deaths the most likely from 2020 to 2029 the study found.
Deaths of despair have been on the rise for the last decade and in the context of COVID-19 deaths of despair should be seen as the epidemic within the pandemic the report reads.

USA TODAY NETWORK  Tennessee
The circle of patients gathered for group therapy at a doctors family practice in McKenzie Tenn. could well represent the face of the states opioid epidemic.
They were in a small city in a rural county fertile ground for prescription drug addiction though they traveled from as far as Nashville and Missouri. They were young or middle-aged and ranged from blue-collar workers to businesspeople. They said painkillers prescribed after accidents or injuries paved the way to their dependence on opioids.
They also were all white.
Of all deaths in 2015 from opioid and heroin overdoses in Tennessee and nationwide about 90 percent of the people were white.
Black people accounted for little more than 6 percent in Tennessee and 8 percent across the country according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.
Among African-Americans critical of the modern drug war launched four decades ago by President Richard Nixon the fact that the opioid epidemic is primarily striking the majority race helps explain why it is largely being called an epidemic and treated as a public health crisis rather than a war.
Look at the inner city its always been what we consider an epidemic said the Rev. Ralph White pastor of Bloomfield Full Gospel Baptist Church in Memphis.
If this had been the case in other areas the community would have been crying out long ago White said. But now that its taking the lives of European Americans we find that its at a time of crisis.
Michael Eric Dyson a Georgetown University sociology professor as well as minister and author offered a similar view after an appearance in February at the University of Memphis.
White brothers and sisters have been medicalized in terms of their trauma and addiction. Black and brown people have been criminalized for their trauma and addiction said Dyson whose latest book is Tears We Cannot Stop A Sermon to White America.
Doctors and other health care professionals certainly are calling for a health care-led response to the opioid epidemic.
Their strategies include curbing use of painkillers like oxycodone making wider use of medications to treat opioid dependence as a chronic disease and increasing mental health services and therapy to attack root causes of addictions.
I would say the good news in Tennessee is that the number of narcotic units prescribed has gone down by almost half said Dr. Daniel Sumrok the physician treating patients at his practice in McKenzie a West Tennessee city with a population of more than 5500 about 130 miles northeast of Memphis.
The bad news is that overdose deaths have gone up and oxycodone has gone up said Sumrok also director of the Center for Addiction Science at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center based in Memphis.
Ironically physician under-treatment of pain for black patients may have helped prevent higher opioid addiction among African-Americans experts and studies suggest.
Sumrok and other health care professionals are careful not to paint the current drug crisis in terms of rich or poor urban or rural black or white.
My patients are district attorneys and teachers and nurses and doctors he said. Theyre not what you might think of as a TV bum theyre people who have real lives real jobs real families real values who found themselves opiate dependent and need some help.
Black and white
Still when it comes to race clear differences emerge.
The National Institutes of Health recently warned that yearly percent increases in deaths among white Americans ages 25 to 30 from 1999 to 2014 rose at rates comparable to the onset of the nations AIDS epidemic or in Russia following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Premature deaths for African-American Hispanic and Asian and Pacific Islanders continued to decline.
Drug overdoses suicide and liver disease are stoking the alarming rise in premature accidental white deaths as well as among American Indians and Alaskan natives the study found.
In high-income countries you expect us to make progress over time you expect the death rate to decrease you expect life expectancy to increase said Meredith Shiels a National Cancer Institute researcher and lead author of the study. So when something comes in and reverses that and suddenly the mortality rate is increasing in any given group that's an alarm that there is something very serious and epidemic going on Shiels said.
Statewide statistics for the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services point to differences between the illegal drugs by race.
For 2015 white Tennesseans made up 89.5 percent of 839 people treated primarily for heroin and 95 percent of 4071 treated for prescription opioids according to the department.
Black Tennesseans made up 62 percent of 1176 treated for cocaine or crack and 45 percent of 2065 in treatment for marijuana use.
Opioid crisis or drug war
The nations previous heroin crisis struck during the Vietnam War era giving rise to the drug war and just say no responses to what was viewed a criminal behavior epidemic said Dr. Altha Stewart a psychiatrist and director of the Center for Health in Justice Involved Youth at UTHSC.
It was considered acceptable that drugs were within the purview of people who were already morally corrupt anyway and so these were things that they did to themselves and you could not rehabilitate them you had to incarcerate them Stewart said.
For todays opioid crisis policymakers are more likely to have experienced children or grandchildren taking grandmas pain medicine and then shifting to cheaper heroin on the street said Stewart who is slated to become the first African-American president of the American Psychiatric Association in mid-2018.
I think that the fact that the people who are experiencing are also the people who are responsible for shaping the policy there is a natural inclination I think to see it differently and to respond to it differently she said.
The opioid crisis also finds medicine and addiction science becoming better equipped to respond with advances in brain imaging genetics and epidemiology Sumrok said.
The UTHSC Center for Addiction Science provides an example. It was named the nations first Center of Excellence in Addiction Medicine last fall for its unusually broad efforts to combat addiction through research and use of basic science treatment community outreach and medical education across all specialties.
Sumrok and Stewart highlighted the importance of trauma measured by adverse childhood experiences research as a game-changing route to treatment and prevention.
I personally see compulsive use disorders as a byproduct of trauma Sumrok said. Trauma can take many forms it can be physical verbal sexual abuse. It can be divorce in a family it can be incarceration in a family it can be another family member thats actively using drugs or a problematic drinker.
With enough trauma to help survive a brain chemical called dopamine involved in triggering pleasure and reward takes over he said.
Remember what were talking about here is a hijacked normal human response that helps you survive he said. Dopamine says to you Lets do that again and you cant help it.
Stewart said adopting the science treatment as well as identifying youths who may be at risk of incarceration is a no-brainer.
There is the role for us we can get out ahead of this Stewart said.
Sumrok said that poverty and the decline of well-paying manufacturing jobs are trauma generators shared by Tennessees urban areas like Memphis and its rural areas like McKenzie.
In Memphis whether the opioid crisis leads to more treatment-oriented policies and an end to the drug war is an open question for White.
It might if they use it to cover every drug addiction not just opioid addiction or prescription medicines if they look at that young guy on the street who is hooked on crack and include him in the process of healing White said. That would be great.
According to the Tennessee Department of Health in 2021 549 people died from an overdose in Shelby County.

MEMPHIS Tenn  Thursday Hope Church in Memphis hosted a discussion called The Addicted Brain showing the science behind how drug and alcohol addiction affects the brain.
According to the Tennessee Department of Health in 2021 549 people died from an overdose in Shelby County.
Presenter Brett Young hopes that understanding why addiction changes people can provide a path to recovery.
Young said he grew up living the American Dream growing up in a happy home becoming a football star and starting a family of his own.
But that changed when he became addicted to painkillers.
I was already drinking alcohol and the combination something changed inside of me Young said. And the captain of the football team became the guy that was screaming at his wife yelling and having sheriffs tear him from his home.
After 15 years in recovery Young has spent the last 14 years helping others on their journey. He is currently the executive director for recovery centers Reprieve for Men and Reprieve for Women.
Young said it is important to understand how drug and alcohol addiction affects the midbrain.
What we know about the midbrain is that's where you have your survival instincts he said. And in those instincts drugs become the priority of survival. And that's why you see the behaviors of addicts and alcoholics.
Memphis counselor Nina Serman works with patients in recovery and said new information and new perspectives can have a major impact.
If they know what's going on for them in their brain that might help them have more hope for long term sobriety she said.
Young said sharing this information is not just about giving addicts an excuse for their behavior.
More to educate people about maybe why they're experiencing different things they are with an addict and also to help them see what the solutions are he said.
Serman said Young can impact lives just by showing others that they can do it too.
The TBI said the use of some of the most common drugs is going down but that's only because the use of others is going up.

MEMPHIS Tenn.  The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is seeing new trends when it comes to illegal drugs. Some of the most common are going down but that is only due to the rise of others.
Tennesseans are dying by overdose by the thousands. Think about thatby the thousands said Marie Williams Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services Commissioner.
The cause is growing. The TBI said drug usage has hit a new high.
It just continues to get worse. In staggering numbers you couldnt imagine and in numbers weve never seen before said David Rausch TBI Director.
Lets start with the positive. Heroin and cocaine have been on a decline. That is due to drugs such as fentanyl and methamphetamine being on the rise. Meth took up 36 of drug lab cases.
It is clear in looking at it that the people making this meth know what theyre doing and theyre doing a very good job of it. Were not dealing with homemade methamphetamine anymore. This is stuff thats coming in in a crystal form thats clearly high purity said Mike Little Assistant Director Forensic Services Division TBI.
The second most common is cannabis marijuana from the actual plant however it has been on a decline. On the flip side fentanyl is in third but is constantly increasing.
Fentanyl on its own is about 100 times more potent than morphine. We see another analog called carfentanil. Carfentanil is 100 times more potent than fentanyl or 10000 more potent than morphine said Little.
TBI has identified 25 different variations of fentanyl or what they call analogs.
The most common disguise is oxycodone. They often appear as blue pills labeled M30.
We have counterfeit M30s that are always coming out of our ears that are always fentanyl said Little.
That puts law enforcement and lab scientists in danger. Its very comforting and scary at the same time to hear a scientist yell at you and say Dont touch that one. Not that one. You better get away from this one. Thats incredibly dangerous. This is unfortunately the world were in said Tommy Farmer TBI SACTDDTF Director.
Fentanyl is now the leading cause of death for people ages 18 to 45 nationwide. It surpasses suicide COVID and car crashes. In response TBI is helping local law enforcement across the state crack down on these illegal substances.

The deadline for doctors to have compliant software is January 1 2021.
Theres a new thing you can shop for and its healthcare services. The Right to Shop law will enforce transparency from health insurance companies. Youll now get the option to see the out-of-pocket pricing for services such as x-rays MRIs and physical therapy.
Theres also a new type of cancer therapy you might not have heard of and its called proton therapy.

2482. That is how many doses of Naloxone Narcan the Memphis Fire Department has projected they will use on suspected opiate overdose patients in 2017.
2482. That is how many doses of Naloxone Narcan the Memphis Fire Department has projected they will use on suspected opiate overdose patients in 2017.
Recent data provided by MFD showed the projected 2482 doses translates to 2146 patients.
Among the patients MFD treated in 2017 was a 19-day-old infant. The oldest patient so far this year was 99-years-old.
In 2010 MFD administered 726 doses of Narcan to 677 patients.
Like communities across the United States Memphians are suffering from the opioid epidemic. With no signs of overdoses slowing down Memphis first responders are doing what they can to stay ahead of it.
We could make 10 to 20 overdoses a day. Some days we dont get any said Adrian McCreight a Memphis Firefighter paramedic.
Over the course of nearly 8 years with MFD McCreight has witnessed the growing number of overdoses.
Yes it does get emotionally draining to see people go down that path but you know were here to help. Were not here to judge said McCreight.
MFD Deputy Chief of Emergency Medical Services Pam Kiestler shared a heat map that indicates the areas where MFD has responded to overdoses virtually every neighborhood has been touched.
The Deputy Chief said theyve seen this growing trend coming. She pointed to the growing presence of fentanyl
Narcan is an antidote that can reverse an opiate overdose. According to Kiestler Narcan has been a longtime fixture on EMS vehicles but now it is in high demand.
So the price we paid per syringe in 2010 was 11.70. We currently pay 35.88 but thats actually at a 30 off the list price said Deputy Chief Kiestler.
The dollar signs mount up. In addition to the drug the tools to administer the drug cost too bringing the total to 44 per kit. MFD purchases the Narcan along with a mucosal atomizer device or IV kit.
We spent with what we administered to patients and what we had in stock in 2010 approximately 12000. This year were expected to spend about 128000 said Kiestler.
Memphis Fire stocks the life-saving resource on every piece of equipment. They cant afford not to.
So far weve been able to rearrange things or delay things to make sure that all the needs are met but theres not an endless supply of dollars to go around. And nobody knows how big this problem is going to get said Kiestler.
In addition to increasing stock within the last year MFD put a parameter in place  a low set point that automatically triggers a reorder whether they are seeing an uptick or not.
The deputy chief said their key to fighting overdoses right now is listening to the data they have at hand and acting.
MEMPHIS Tenn. - A man's family is struggling to accept a man's death and to get straight answers about his death.
Dustin Pittman died of a fentanyl overdose while in rehab at Serenity Recovers Centers in Memphis.
I'm very angry. Grief comes in different forms Pittman's sister Amber Holbrook told FOX13 Investigates. I'll never get to see his smile again.
Pittman grew up playing basketball and hockey but like many other cases documented by FOX13 Investigates he developed an addiction to alcohol and drugs specifically fentanyl.
431 FOX13 Investigates How prosecutors are working to end a deadly drug crisis FOX13 is continuing to investigate the powerful drug that investigators said killed two teenaged girls at a Fayette County school.
Addiction led Pittman to be arrested several times for burglary drugs charges and two DUIs. The first time Pittman was arrested for DUI in 2019 Memphis Police saved his life with Narcan. The second time he was ordered to rehab.
He had the shine back in his eyes said his mother Montie Holbrook said of her son after visiting him in rehab for the first time.
Sadly that would also be the last time she saw her son.
Pittman died four days later.
Police told Montie Holbrook that he was found decease3d at Serenity rehab in Memphis.
An autopsy obtained by FOX13 showed that Pittman died of an accidental fentanyl overdose. FOX13 Investigates discovered that the State of Tennessee conducted their own investigation into Pittman's death at Serenity.
202 Teen to be tried as adult in deadly overdoses of two Fayette-Ware High students A 17-year-old girl charged in the death of two Fayette-Ware High students will be prosecuted as an adult a judge ruled Wednesday.
That investigation found that the rehab center conducted hourly rounds the night of his death eventually finding him unresponsive.
The State found that Serenity was within staffing ratios and did not find any violations on the rehab's part.
A lot of time it's just like 'Just one more time' said Light Walleman who works for A Betor Way.
204 Narcan will soon be available without a prescription in Shelby County Opioid overdoses killed more people in Shelby County from 2018 to 2020 than car accidents.
Walleman and his collogues at A Betor Way work closely with the addicted supplying clean syringes disease testing and offering help to those who want to quit.
There's a saying 'Dead addicts don't recover' Walleman said.
Walleman a recovering addict himself told FOX13 that many times drugs inside of rehab centers come from new patients.
It's pretty difficult to have anything brought in when you're in there. It typically comes in with new individuals. There's ways of hiding it Walleman said.
Walleman warned those who are using that one last high could be more literal than you intend.
To a lot of people this has been their lifestyle for years. I've heard stories that last hoorah and that's exactly what it is.. If they're not ready to get honest and really put the work in it won't work Walleman said.
FOX13 RESOURCE GUIDE for teens struggling with substance abuse MEMPHIS Tenn. - Following the deaths of two students suspected of drug overdoses at a high 
FOX13 Investigates reached out to Serenity about Pittman's death. Despite numerous promises of return calls we never heard back. Pittman's family said they are also experiencing a lack of communication with the treatment center.
They don't want to give you straight answers Montie Holbrook said. Pure torture agony sadness depression.. a lot of questions.
FAYETTE COUNTY Tenn. - Days after two teen girls died of suspected overdoses at Fayette-Ware High School a 17-year-old girl has been charged with their murder according District Attorney Mark Davidson.
Davidson said that a 17-year-old girl also a junior at the high school has been charged with two counts of second-degree murder for the deaths of the 16- and 17-year-old girls. She's also been charged with possession of a controlled substance.
That 17-year-old girl also overdosed and was rushed to the hospital in critical condition but was released from the hospital hours later. After her release she was charged with the death of her classmates.
There was a special hearing at the courthouse in Somerville Thursday morning.
No cameras were allowed because this case involves a juvenile.
That 17-year-old is due back in court on June 7 Davidson said.
Both girls who died were juniors at the school and died hours before the school was set to hold graduation. They along with the girl who survived and is now charged were found in a car outside of the school around 440 p.m. on Tuesday May 16 the Fayette County Sheriff's Office said in a press release.

The sheriff's office said that drugs found at the scene and a home where a search warrant were carried out were sent to a crime lab for analysis but preliminary reports indicate that Fentanyl was found.
After her first court hearing on May 18 the surviving 17-year-old was released to her family's care with an ankle monitor only being allowed to attend school and counseling.
341 Fayette County Chief Deputy opens up about drug overdoses after 2 teen deaths Fayette County officials say that drug overdoses in that county have spiked since May 2021.
Fayette County Sheriff's Office Chief Deputy Ray Garcia told FOX13 that there were 158 overdoses resulting in 21 deaths in Fayette County between May 1 2021 and Dec. 31 2022.
Already in 2023 the county has seen 42 overdoses resulting in four deaths including the two teenage girls who died after their suspected overdose at Fayette-Ware High School.
Balloons were release Thursday afternoon in the girls' honor.
Its heartbreaking that it happened especially on the night of graduation said Vicki Gregory a community member.
I dont know anything about this fentanyl but I heard its a dangerous drug said Ann Smith a community member.
Investigators said they found drugs that may be fentanyl at the crime scene and at the suspect's home.
Officials said text messages and social media helped investigators find evidence to help with the investigation.
You think you're getting meth you think youre getting coke or you think youre getting opioid in a pressed pill. There is a real chance there can be fentanyl in that pill and you may never know it said Davidson the district attorney.
Davidson said since the pandemic theyve seen an alarming increase of drug overdoses in Fayette County just as there has been across the country.
But he said this is the first time a fatal overdose here involved teenagers.
The district attorney said the county is working to provide drug prevention programs to help reduce overdoses for adults as well as kids.
We have a public awareness campaign we are trying to get started a drug-free coalition in Fayette County. The need is there Davidson said.
MEMPHIS Tenn. WMC - When many eyes were on the COVID-19 pandemic another crisis continued to grow.
Deaths from opioid and other drug overdoses have gone up since 2020.
Some addiction recovery specialists are getting ready to offer more resources to people with addiction in the hardest-hit areas of Shelby County.
The main cause of the increase in overdose deaths is due to fentanyl-laced drugs. Addiction recovery specialists say the dangerous drug is now being made in pill form resembling more common anxiety or pain medications.
By learning more about the drug issue in Memphis Stevie Moore wanted to do what he could to help.
Stevie Moores Freedom From Unnecessary Negatives or FFUN is usually advocating against gun violence. On Saturday the organizations building on South Third Street welcomed an effort to fight another thing contributing to unnecessary deaths-drugs
Both of us are actually doing the same thing Moore said. Yall are trying to stop killing through drugs and Im trying to stop killing through guns.
FFUNs involvement in this cause doesnt end there.
On Monday the Memphis Area Prevention Coalition will open a harm reduction center for people with addictions at the FFUN building.
A syringe exchange program is part of the center the center will also offer HIV and Hepatitis C testing and provide Narcan the opioid overdose reversal drug to those who need it. All of the resources will be available at a low or zero cost.
Community organizers say the 38109 zip code in the southern part of the city is starting to see an increase in fatal drug overdoses.
We are on a steady increase with this were seeing more drugs were seeing more of a problem Memphis Area Prevention Coalitions Joh Weil said. This is our answer to that.
Before the harm reduction center opens on Monday multiple organizations focusing on addiction recovery passed out resources like Narcan to those who need it.
What we wanted to do today was have the neighborhood come out and understand what the mission is to know that were here without any cost involved with them. We want to help save lives Ron Bobal said.
According to the Shelby County Health Department as of last week there have been 94 deaths due to suspected overdoses since the beginning of the year.
The Memphis Area Prevention Coalition says more than half of those overdoses have been in black men. The group calls this unprecedented. The group explains over the last decade the opioid epidemic has usually impacted white people the most. This is the first time in that time frame the group has seen a majority of overdose deaths in Black men.
However the numbers are showing no one is immune to this crisis.
From 2019 to 2020 we saw a 45 increase in fatal overdoses 85 increase in fentanyl overdoses Weil said.
Saturdays event and the new harm reduction center are the product of multiple agencies with the same goal.
Memphis is worth saving Bobal said.
The harm reduction center on South Third Street will be open every Monday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.

The Jan. 1 death of Three 6 Mafia artist Gangsta Boo shocked the hip-hop world and highlighted the fentanyl epidemic in America. While there has been no official ruling on Gangsta Boos cause of death it is believed she died of a possible fentanyl overdose.
The 43-year-old artist whose real name is Lola Mitchell had attended a concert in Memphis Tenn. with her brother on Dec. 31 where he wound up overdosing and needed hospitalization. He recovered but Gangsta Boo was found dead the next day around 4 p.m. at her home.
Sources told Page Six that narcotics were found on Gangsta Boos person.
Its suspected that a fentanyl-laced substance is responsible for Gangsta Boos death but police are investigating.
Considered heroins synthetic cousin fentanyl is stronger and deadlier than heroin and up to 100 times more potent than morphine according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is a prescription drug that is also made and used illegally. It is typically used to treat patients with severe pain especially after surgery. But fentanyl that is sold on the street is usually made in a clandestine lab STAT News reported.
Fentanyl deaths in the U.S. are on the rise.
Fentanyl is killing Americans at an unprecedented rate said DEA Administrator Anne Milgram in April 2022. Already this year numerous mass-overdose events have resulted in dozens of overdoses and deaths. Drug traffickers are driving addiction and increasing their profits by mixing fentanyl with other illicit drugs. Tragically many overdose victims have no idea they are ingesting deadly fentanyl until its too late.
The CDC estimates that in the 12-month period ending in October 2021 more than 105000 Americans died of drug overdoses with 66 percent of those deaths related to synthetic opioids like fentanyl. In 2021 the U.S. experienced more fentanyl-related deaths than gun- and auto-related deaths combined.

Because of fentanyl the era of harmless drug experimentation with pills or powders is over. The street drug supply is poisoned. We have to make sure our social-media-savvy children understand  really and truly that one pill can kill wrote Los Angeles Times columnist Robin Abcarian.
The government is cracking down on corporations profiting from opioid abuse. Major drug companies distributors and pharmacy chains reached settlements of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governments totaling more than 50 billion NPR reported.
Fentanyl remains available on the streets and there have been reports of fentanyl being added to marijuana and sold to unknowing marijuana users. In December 2022 the Drug Enforcement Administration said it had seized far greater quantities of illicit fentanyl than ever before in 2022.
Today the U.S. House will pass a long-term solution to keep the federal government open.

Pioneering female rapper Gangsta Boo died on New Years Day from an accidental drug overdose according to an autopsy report that was published more than six months after the Memphis musicians death shocked the hip-hop community.
TMZ reported Thursday that the Memphis-based rapper born Lola Chantrelle Mitchell died at 43 as a result of a toxic mixture of fentanyl cocaine and liquor.
In the days after Mitchell died speculation ran rampant about the cause of her death. She was found dead on New Years Day at a home in Memphis just hours after celebrating the end of 2022 with her family at a concert. She had been showing no signs of distress in the hours before her death according to reports. The Memphis Police Department also said there were no obvious signs of foul play. TMZ previously cited a source to report that Mitchells death appears to be drug-related.
MORE Why Are People Lacing Cocaine With Fentanyl And How Dangerous Is It
Throughout history drug addictions have plagued the lives of so many celebrities. Drugs have always been a part of celebrity culture. Actors singers politicians even social media influencers have all abused drugs which has led to the deaths of some of our favorite celebrities. Imagine being poor then one day you wake up with access to millions of dollars.
Your fame and fortune can get you whatever you want including drugs. For many Americans a drug habit can set you back financially but not celebrities. They have access to substances the average person cant get their hands on. Many entertainers feel the only way to escape is to numb their world by heavy drug use which many times can lead to drug overdoses. Highly addictive substances like heroin and cocaine have been drugs of choice by celebrities for decades. They also happen to be the most lethal.
Cocaine which is also known as the party drug is especially very popular among entertainers. Although not as lethal as the opioids it is extremely addictive. Since it can be mixed with an opioid like fentanyl and go undetected some celebrities have been unintentionally taking the opioid and overdosing by accident.
Comedian Fuquan Johnson was one of two people who overdosed on cocaine laced with fentanyl at a party in Los Angeles on Sept. 2 2021. A third person survived the overdose. Johnsons death sparked widespread concern in the broader entertainment industry that more celebrities could be at risk of the same fate because so many of them use cocaine from possibly the same source.
On top of that actor Michael K. Williams overdose death in his Brooklyn penthouse on Sept. 6 2021 was also attributed to fentanyl that was used to lace heroin. Even though Williams admitted fight with drug addiction was well documented his death still caught people off guard.
To be sure drug overdoses arent a new phenomenon to entertainers. Michael Jackson and Prince both overdosed on opioids but they are far from the only ones who died in that or a similar manner.
Keep reading to find a running list that we hopefully wont need to update too often of notable Black people who died following drug overdoses.
Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is considered many times more potent than heroin.
Authorities in Tennessee say a mother and father have been charged with giving the dangerous opioid fentanyl to their 4-year-old son who later died.
The U.S Marshals Service said in a news release Thursday that Kristen Raley and Jon Allen have been arrested in Shelby County on charges of first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse.
Authorities said Raley and Allen gave their child fentanyl in a hotel room.

MEMPHIS Tenn.  Fentanyl cocaine marijuana and now xylazine are taking to the streets of Memphis. The drug has been around for years and more recently as a substance some dealers have used to lace other drugs with.
Every time you experiment or use something in our city it could be the last time  that you are alive A Betor Way founder Ron Bobal said.
The Memphis Police Department received more than 1200 overdose calls in the first five months of 2023. A Betor Ways Vice President Kathryn Goforth said she recently had a friend die from an overdose.
I have a friend that just died a couple months ago because he uses cocaine occasionally and it had fentanyl in it and he overdosed and died because he was by himself Goforth said.
Many outpatient clinics still seeing fentanyl on a daily basis.
Just the main things that were seeing is fentanyl is the issue Goforth said. They break down a little bit of what they have whatever the substance may be and they put some water in it and dissolve it and then they test it to see if fentanyl is in it.
But a newer drug claiming lives is xylazine and its putting the West Tennessee drug task force on high alert Director of the task force Johnie Carter said.
We are seeing a rise in fentanyl coming into Memphis Carter said. When youre doing fentanyl of course youve got naloxone and stuff that will counteract those. But with xylazine which were seeing mixed a lot with fentanyl. Right now almost all the fentanyl were getting is mixed with xylazine and naloxone does not work on xylazine.
Naloxone being the active ingredient in Narcan and other branded medicines used to reverse most overdoses but not an overdose from xylazine. If you arent testing substances with test strips before using them Light Walleman with A Betor Way said sores might be the only hint that what youre using is laced with xylazine.
Xylazine is so new right and were seeing actual open sores on a persons forearms legs and inner thighs and inner extremities mostly Walleman said. There has been some research done recently and what theyre finding out is it doesnt matter how xylazine is ingested it kind of populates on the limbs and it creates these sores.
The West Tennessee Drug Task Force said its working to continue patrolling high traffic areas to stop the distribution of drugs before its too late.
The main thing is to let somebody know that youre using Bobal said. Dont use alone and find somebody to talk to about it theres lots of opportunity for people to reach out and you can seek help.

Sonny West Elvis Presleys former friend and bodyguard claimed in his 2007 book Elvis Still Taking Care of Business that Presley once hit a woman with a pool cue hard enough to knock her over.
Rock and roll legend Elvis Presley was known for being a man of contradictions.
His closest friends loved ones and associates  including those in the Memphis Mafia his tight-knit group of employees security personnel and confidantes  claimed that he was both a generous giving friend and a troubled man with a dark side. He was well-loved by those who knew him but many of his colleagues also knew him to be impulsive and sometimes plagued by an explosive temper.
One anecdote shared by Sonny West Presleys former bodyguard along with his cousin Red West and longtime friend in his 2007 book Elvis Still Taking Care of Business exemplified one of the Kings darker moments. West alleged that Presley while under the influence of drugs hit a young woman with a pool cue hard enough to knock her over.
Elvis Presley  RBRedferns
Presleys friend claimed he could sometimes be impulsive and unpredictable
In Elvis Still Taking Care of Business West reflected on a story that to him exemplified both Presleys substance abuse issues as his career heated up and his friends subservience to him for better or for worse.
Over time West wrote members of the Memphis Mafia began to notice that Presleys drug use went beyond the typical partying associated with the rock and roll lifestyle. He alleged that Presley began to doctor-shop for various pills which could sometimes make the usually friendly gregarious and warm singer become impulsive mercurial and wildly unpredictable.
One evening West took Judy Alden an actress he was casually dating to a party at one of Presleys homes on Bellagio Road in Los Angeles.
Presley was shooting pool with the guys as usual when West walked in with his date. But he could tell that the singer wasnt his normal self. He seemed cold aloof and put out. West said Presley grew increasingly frustrated during a game of eight ball as he missed a lot of easy shots he normally would have made.

West claimed Presley became incensed at a party over a minor incident
From there things only went from bad to worse.
Wests date began to grow bored as she realized that meeting the King of Rock and Roll wasnt turning out the way shed hoped. Alden finally told West she wanted to leave and asked him to move his car which was blocking hers in the driveway.
Presley  who was normally the consummate gentleman with female guests  began to bark at his friend asking what the hell his date wanted.
West tried to deescalate the situation by speaking softly but Presley was having none it.
Finally Elvis blew West wrote adding that he screamed explosively Hell man youre playing pool Let her get someone else to move the car.

The bodyguard alleged that the singer hit a young actress with a pool cue
After seeing Presley blow up over something so minor Alden figured out that something wasnt quite right. Now she wanted to leave more than ever  but it wasnt going to be so easy.
According to West Presley screamed and swore yet again when Alden continued to ask if she could go home. Finally tired of being yelled at Alden screamed back telling Presley to go to hell.
At that point Presley threw his pool cue at Judy striking her in the chest West wrote in Elvis Still Taking Care of Business. She fell to the floor and when I ran over to her she was crying.
Stunned and still crumpled on the floor Alden asked why the singer had assaulted her. West realized at that point that there was no good answer he could give.
West speculated that the alleged incident must have been drug-related since Presley had taken uppers that night. Although Presley wasnt immune from the occasional outburst West insisted that violence against women in any form was usually unlike him.
Elvis did have a bad temper but he would never do something like that to a woman if he wasnt under the influence of something Presleys friend mused.

Presleys friend admitted that no one stood up to defend the alleged victim
Presley was visibly stunned and disgusted by his own behavior after the pool cue incident but his pride wouldnt allow him to apologize. Instead West had to do the apologizing for Presley. He nervously hemmed and hawed about the singer being under stress as he made sure she was OK and led her out of the house.
Obviously Presley isnt here to defend himself or give his side of the story so we cant know for sure what happened. Still several other sources close to the singer have since affirmed Wests version of events according to the Elvis History Blog.
For his part West was shocked that Alden never pursued legal action or any kind of lawsuit against Presley after the incident. He also realized something unfortunate about himself in the process how far he and his friends were willing to go to protect Presleys reputation  even if he was in the wrong.
I hate to admit this but none of us would have backed her up West confessed as to what he would have done if Alden had taken action against the King. To this day I dont feel good about that statement.
More than 1.9 million people have watched Courtland Garners below Oct. 3 Facebook Live video of a Memphis couple passing out on the sidewalk. According to WREG police believe the husband and wife snorted some heroin in a nearby Walgreens bathroom and then collapsed.
Though the fire department was able to revive both of them the pair look to be in critical condition Carla Hiers who was arrested once revived is crouched with her knees to her chest her face on the sidewalk and struggles to speak as people get in her face and laugh at her. Her husband whos not been named is hunched in a bridge a few feet away unmoving as a cell phone rings in his hand.
Thousands have commented on the cruel nature of the video wondering why Garner is and others are filming instead of calling the police. He says someone had called the paramedics before he arrived though no one shows up during the filming.
What they were doing was children things. It was a spectacle. It made me laugh. They can help themselves he told WREG. I know for a fact all the kids are on social media and when kids see that video you know what they are going to say I dont want to look stupid like that I dont want to do those drugs.

OXFORD Miss.  In 2008 Ricky Clayton was in his early 50s lost in the throes of a life-threatening painkiller addiction and homeless in Memphis.
Substance abuse had been with him like a shadow for more than 30 years. In 2005 his brother died alone from a heroin overdose in a Burger King bathroom. Clayton who was himself hopelessly addicted to dilaudid a powerful opioid prescription painkiller also took methadone or heroin both readily available opioids that helped him avoid the painful symptoms of drug withdrawal when he didnt have dilaudid.
I was pretty much hopeless Clayton said. I had tried to quit the pain pills over and over and I couldnt stay clean so I just went and got on methadone which is a terrible addiction too but it keeps you from being sick. You can take that and it lasts all day.
Though the odds were stacked against him Claytons story has a happy ending. On Saturday May 14 Clayton 60 now a clean and sober grandfather will receive his bachelors degree in social work from the University of Mississippi.
A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study published in January found the yearly rate of U.S. opioid deaths has tripled since 2000. In 2014 drug overdoses accounted for one-and-a-half times more deaths than from car crashes. More than half a million people in the United States have died from overdoses since 2000 with opioid pain relievers and heroin being the main drugs associated with those deaths.
All this makes Claytons achievement a monumental one. The pride he feels in this milestone is evident when its mentioned.
Its a dream I had when I was young and I never thought I was going to be able to attain it because of my addiction but if you stay clean it goes to show you anything is possible Clayton said. Im going to be so proud.
I had a lot of help. A lot of good friends just kept encouraging me. Its hard to believe I finally made it.
Claytons addiction story began in the 1970s. Pills started as a recreational drug when he was a young man who like many of his generation experimented.
I never thought it would end up the way it did Clayton said. I was just really curious and it progressed and before I knew it I was addicted. You become physically addicted to the opiates and it changes your whole world because its like a mental obsession. You have to have it. Youre also physically addicted. Its terrible.
While he was homeless the Memphis Union Mission on Poplar Avenue became a haven for Clayton. On cold nights if he could afford the 6 cost of lodgings he was able to stay there and get a meal. Downtown churches also feed the homeless.
You just learn how to survive Clayton said. There are a lot of people there living off the street. Ive slept under a bridge before.
On the streets of Memphis in 2008 he began to take stock of what addiction had done. Hed watched it kill his brother end his own marriage cause him to lose his job and lead to him doing a stint in jail. Ultimately it caused him to not be able to afford a place to live and had left him homeless for a year.
He decided to go for his sixth stint in rehab. He was determined to do whatever it took to get better.
Addiction counselors at Haven House in Oxford urged him to begin college classes at Northwest Community College and follow the dream of earning a diploma that hed abandoned years ago when drugs overtook his life. He worked at Haven House and studied at Northwest then came to Ole Miss.
While studying here hes leaned heavily on UMs Collegiate Recovery Community which offers a community of support for recovering students to help them achieve academic goals. The comfort hes found with the group has helped tremendously he said.
They helped me financially plus we meet on campus every few weeks and just share problems we are having with our education Clayton said. Thats a great resource that a lot of people dont know about.
Susan Nicholas an academic mentor for FASTrack who is also a Collegiate Recovery Community volunteer said Clayton is one of the hardest working students shes ever known.
Many things about college did not come easily or naturally for him and he painstakingly worked through those things Nicholas said. However what did come naturally to Ricky was engagement with new ideas. He has been an excellent student while also working an almost full-time job and giving service in the recovery community.
She sees a bright future for Clayton.
Ricky has been and will continue to be an asset to our community for many years Nicholas said. I am so grateful he chose the University of Mississippi.
Clayton has been a natural leader and mentor for younger students in the group said Beth Spencer a lecturer in English and the CRC faculty adviser. Spencer said hes also one of the hardest workers shes ever met.
He arrives early to the meetings to help set up and stays late to help clean up Spencer said. Over the years he has met academic challenges by seeking out professors and staff on campus who can assist him always with a steady determination and positive attitude. The CRC would not be the same without Ricky.
For the past three years Clayton has also helped others reclaim their lives as a staff member at Oxford Treatment Center a private addiction treatment provider in northeastern Lafayette County.
He has worked as a weekend counselor for its sober living program while completing his internship during the week at its Oxford Outpatient Office. His work has included facilitating a weekly aftercare group that supports those in their first two years after treatment.
Rickys dedication is inspiring to all of us said Lisa Hillhouse a clinical therapist at the center who supervised Clayton through his internship there.
His personal experience alongside his education and training have made him so effective in helping our clients. They know he understands their perspective and they can sense how deeply he cares. We value the difference he makes in peoples lives and are so proud to celebrate what hes accomplished.
Claytons two grown sons and his grandchild will be among those cheering him on at Commencement. Restoring relationships with his family has been an important priority during his recovery. He is also focused on pursuing a masters degree in social work.
He urges those who are struggling with addiction to seek professional help to get sober and also to lean on the support of a recovery community while they pursue their dreams.
You have to keep persevering and never give up Clayton said. Dont be discouraged by how far away your goal seems to be. You can do it if you just keep trying one day at a time.

Editor's note The federal charges against Dr. Thomas Hughes for nine counts of illegally dispensing testosterone to himself were dismissed in September 2019.
Four medical professionals in Memphis including one practicing Memphis-based psychiatrist who is accused of trading fraudulent opioid prescriptions for sexual favors were charged with controlled substances violations as part of a federal crackdown on medical professionals who use their credentials to illegally prescribe opioids to others.
Dubbed the Appalachian Regional Prescription Opioid Strike Force or ARPO the multi-agency operation identified and charged 60 health care officials in Tennessee Ohio Kentucky West Virginia and Alabama.
On Wednesday Attorney General William P. Barr and Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II announced the results of the sting alongside law enforcement partners from several states.
The opioid epidemic is the deadliest drug crisis in American history and Appalachia has suffered the consequences more than perhaps any other region Barr said.
During a Thursday news conference in Memphis federal prosecutors identified medical professionals in the area who were swept up in the raid.
U.S. Attorney D. Michael Dunavant described the charged individuals as white-coated drug dealers with prescription pads and promised more indictments were on the way as the multi-agency task force continues its investigations.
Dunavant also said the opioid epidemic is now costing 130 Americans their lives every day.
Indictments have been filed against
Michael Hellman
Hellman 72 is accused of selling large amounts of promethazine with codeine to patients without first administering a physical examination as well as unlawfully distributing controlled substances.
Hellman is an anesthesiologist with a practice based in Collierville where he specializes in pain management and addiction medicine according to several online medical practitioner registries.
Thomas Hughes
Hughes 69 is a licensed endocrinologist facing nine counts of illegally dispensing testosterone to himself.
Richard Farmer
Farmer is a psychiatrist with a practice in East Memphis and is accused of prescribing hydrocodone and aprazolam or Xanax to female patients in exchange for sexual favors or their companionship.
He is also accused of keeping inadequate patient records prescribing addictive substances to patients before meeting them and not requiring a drug screen for some patients before prescribing the sometimes deadly combination of hydrocodone and alprazolam.
James Litton
Litton 43 is a former nurse practitioner accused of illegally prescribing Schedule II controlled substances such as alprazolam clonazepam and carisoprodol.
Litton who owns Consolidated Health Services of Memphis fired another named defendant former nurse practitioner Kathryn Russell from his practice last year when Russell's own charges came to light.
Litton is also accused of committing health care fraud in connection to billing charges for unnecessary diagnostic tests.
Others indicted in West Tennessee
Jeffrey Young a nurse practitioner in Jackson has been accused of prescribing opioids and other addictive medications without justification and sometimes receiving sexual favors as payment.
Indicted alongside Young were Dr. Alexander Alperovich and Dr. Andrew Rudin according to federal court records. All three suspects are charged with conspiracy to distribute and dispense controlled substances and other drug-related charges.
Dr. Charles Alston and nurse practitioner Britney Petway both of the Superior Health and Wellness Clinic in Jackson were charged with conspiracy to distribute and dispense controlled substances.
Dr. Thomas Ballard III another Jackson medical professional was charged with multiple counts of unlawful drug distribution and distributing a controlled substance resulting in death or serious bodily injury. In total Ballard illegally prescribed 4.2 million opioid pills authorities say.
Dr. Jay Shires Dr. Loran Karlosky and nurse practitioner Mary Ann Board all of the Downtown Medical Clinic in Bells have been charged with multiple counts of unlawfully distributing and dispensing a controlled substance and one count of conspiracy.
Pharmacist Glenn Bonifield Jr. and pharmacy technician Michelle Bonifield both of whom worked at the Mehr Drug Store in Bells have been charged with multiple counts of unlawfully distributing and dispensing a controlled substance and one count of conspiracy.
If convicted all defendants will face up to 20 years in federal prison and fines up to 1 million.
Dunavant We're just getting started
Dunavant said this week's indictments in no way signal the end of the operation and that agencies would continue to pour agents and resources into identifying and prosecuting medical professionals illegally distributing prescriptions for deadly and addictive drugs.
I had no problem signing these indictments and there's more to come Dunavant said.
Further Dunavant confirmed medical professionals who are found to have contributed to an individual's overdose death by way of fraudulent opioid prescriptions will face further charges.
Shelby County District Attorney General Amy Weirich instituted a similar prosecution policy recently among more traditional drug dealers under Shelby County's heroin initiative.
Weirich warned medical professionals that they would be just as heavily hunted and prosecuted should they decide to peddle opiates for profits from their own patients.
When doctors those that we go to to save our lives are causing death because of their greed and because of their horrible horrible judgment ... it's too much to take. We will find you we're watching you and we will prosecute you Weirich said.
The ARPO operation has 13 districts where multiple agencies are currently embedded.
Of the 13 districts West Tennessee yielded the highest number of indictments in the entire operation.

Memphis Commercial Appeal
The city of Memphis sued 21 pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors on March 7 joining a growing number of local and state governments across the nation seeking reimbursement for the high costs associated with rampant opioid addiction.
The city cites a significant increase in the use of prescription opioid pain medications as a result of the company's deceptive marketing campaign and a failure to report suspicious orders of the medicine according to court documents. Shelby County and Tennessee filed similar lawsuits last year.
Documents from the lawsuit said despite the knowledge of the risks of the drug companies continued to market the drug by creating a false perception of safety for the drug in the minds of medical professionals and members of the public.
Court documents said the Connecticut-based company Purdue Pharma was aware of the fatal risks of the opioid drug OxyContin and other brand-name drugs like oxycodone and hydrocodone.
The campaign on opioid use by the companies profited 8 billion in revenue 3.1 billion went to Purdue Pharma for its OxyContin sales according to court documents.
The National Institute of Health was cited in the lawsuit identifying the aggressive marketing of the opioid drugs as a major cause in the abuse of opioids usage.
Several factors are likely to have contributed to the severity of the current prescription drug abuse problem the statement read in the document.
They include drastic increases in the number of prescriptions written and dispensed greater social acceptability for using medications for different purposes and aggressive marketing by pharmaceutical companies.
The United States Department of Food and Drug Administration called for the removal of Endo Pharmaceuticals' opioid pain medication from the market because the benefits of the drug may no longer outweigh its risks.
In 2007 Purdue and three of its executives pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges for
misleading regulators doctors and patients about OxyContins risk of addiction and its potential to be abused according to court documents.
The misuse and abuse of prescription opioids is a complex public health challenge that requires a collaborative and systemic response that engages all stakeholders. Given our role the idea that distributors are responsible for the number of opioid prescriptions written defies common sense and lacks understanding of how the pharmaceutical supply chain actually works and is regulated said John Parker senior vice president of the Healthcare Distribution Alliance in a statement on Wednesday.
Those bringing lawsuits would be better served addressing the root causes rather than trying to redirect blame through litigation.
In 2016 the FDA recognized opioid abuse as a public health crisis according to court documents.

The fatal overdose of a 53-year-old man last year has been ruled a 2017 homicide after two suspects accused of supplying the victim with the drugs were recently charged in his death.
Bertrand Tuggle Jr. died from a drug overdose on Aug.10 according to Memphis police.
Aaron Lipford 53 and Justin Slepicka 23 were charged with second-degree murder in connection with his death.
The Shelby County Medical Examiner's office ruled that Tuggle died from fentanyl toxicity. Fentanyl is painkiller and is the drug that an autopsy report revealed killed music superstar Prince last year.
The ruling was made in 2017 therefore it will count against the 2017 number said police spokesman Louis Brownlee about Tuggle's death being ruled the 20th homicide of 2017.
Slepicka and Lipford are accused of supplying Tuggle with a fatal dose of heroin-laced fentanyl according to police.
The pair were indicted on Jan. 31 in Tuggle's death.
In addition to the murder charge Slepicka was also charged with manufacturing delivering and selling heroin in a drug-free school zone. He is in custody.
Lipford was charged with second-degree murder possession of a controlled substance with intent to manufacture deliver and sell possession of drug paraphernalia manufacturing delivering and selling heroin in a drug free school zone and possession of a firearm while committing a dangerous felony.
Lipford is not in custody and a warrant has been issued for his arrest.
As the number of heroin -related deaths increases in Memphis and Shelby County local law enforcement officials are making it a priority to combat the problem by charging individuals who supply the drugs that lead to overdoses.
Last year Haley High and Jerrico Long were indicted for second-degree murder in the Feb. 22 heroin-related death of 33-year-old Corey Goodrum.
Johnathan Clark listed as age 0 was also included on MPD's 2016 homicide list. It is not clear if the victim was a baby or a fetus. Memphis police have not named a suspect in the child's death but lists the suspect's relationship as family and the cause of the child's death as drugs.
U.S. Attorney Ed Stanton's office and the office of Shelby County District Attorney Amy Weirich hired a prosecutor last year to go after those responsible for heroin overdoses and deaths.
Federal officials said Memphis police investigated 222 heroin overdoses last year with 77 deaths.
Health officials in Tennessee's largest county say the number of overdoses related to opioids and other drugs has surged in the past month reaching 58 deaths in a 30-day period.
Shelby County which includes Memphis reported 391 suspected overdoses from April 7 to May 7 according to a news release from the county health department. The 58 deaths is the highest county total for a 30-day period since record keeping began in January 2019 using a database of incidents reported by first reponders and the West Tennessee Regional Forensic Center.
The county health department said it has issued seven spike alerts in the past month. The alerts call attention to a sharp rise in drug overdoses including those involving opioids.
In a news release health department director Alisa Haushalter said the contributing factors are not clear but the trend is concerning.
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic it is important that those with substance use issues continue to have access to the care they need Haushalter said.
In a news conference last week Haushalter said it is important for communities to have access to Narcan a medication used to reverse opioid overdoses.
Fentanyl a synthetic opioid used for years to treat severe pain or to manage post-operative pain has been in the news in recent years due to a sharp upward surge in drug overdose deaths attributable to an illicit form of the drug that is sweeping the nation.
Federal authorities in Little Rock said Arkansas has not been able to avoid that surge.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2020 drug overdoses claimed 546 lives in Arkansas putting the state 37th in the nation for overdose deaths at 19.1 deaths due to overdose per 100000 people. The CDC said that is a 41 increase from the previous year.
Once fentanyl came on the scene it ushered in the deadliest era weve seen yet when it comes to drugs said Jarad Harper the assistant special agent in charge of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration district office in Little Rock. Drug overdoses are now the leading killer of Americans between the age of 18 and 45 and 70 of those deaths are caused by synthetic opioids like fentanyl.
Illegally manufactured fentanyl first began showing up in drugs such as heroin and cocaine a few years ago to increase the euphoric effects of those drugs but it is now being found in counterfeit prescription drugs often present without the users knowledge and often with fatal results. According to the CDC drug overdoses claimed the lives of a record 107622 people in the U.S. in 2021 with nearly 72000 of those deaths  67 of the total  attributable to synthetic opioids.
According to the CDC fentanyl is some 50 to 100 times more potent than heroin and morphine and as little as 2 milligrams can be fatal.
DEA officials warned last December that criminal drug networks in Mexico are mass-producing deadly fentanyl and fentanyl-laced fake prescription pills using chemicals sourced largely from China. These fake prescription pills are designed to appear identical to legitimate prescription drugs  such as Oxycontin Percocet Vicodin Adderall Xanax and other medicines  and have been found in every state in the country and often contain deadly doses of fentanyl. DEA has determined that four out of 10 fake prescription pills tested contain lethal amounts of fentanyl.
In 2021 alone the DEA said it seized enough fentanyl to provide a lethal dose of the drug to every man woman and child in the United States much of it in the form of fake prescription pills and the onslaught of fentanyl hasnt let up in 2022.
Harper said with millions of fake prescription pills and tons of powdered fentanyl being brought into the U.S. the problem crosses into all walks of American life.
He called fentanyl the single deadliest drug threat our nation has ever encountered.
He said most of the fentanyl coming into the U.S. is manufactured by one of two Mexican drug cartels the Sinaloa and CJNG cartels using raw materials obtained from China.
They synthesize these massive quantities of fentanyl they press them into these fake pills that look like legitimate medications Harper said.
Theyre known for selling these products to people who may not even be looking for fentanyl. Thats the most alarming thing to me  that these pills are out there and they look almost identical.
The counterfeit pills Harper said are coming into the country by the millions.
Were working hard here at the DEA to get our arms around it but were not going to arrest our way out of this Harper said.
Its going to take more than a state effort and more than law enforcement. Were trying to pull in experts in prevention and dependency medical examiners prosecutors offices at the state and federal levels  its going to take a full-court press to get our arms around this thing.
At the U.S. Attorneys Office in Little Rock Chris Givens the deputy criminal chief handles a large caseload of fentanyl cases and recently headed the prosecution of Jemel Foster who was convicted by a jury last July of distribution of fentanyl resulting in death and faces a possible life sentence when he comes up for sentencing later this year.
Givens said so far this year the office is handling five cases of fentanyl distribution resulting in death three of which he is handling personally.
Several more cases he said are under investigation and could result in indictments in coming months.
What makes the cases more complex than simple trafficking cases he said is the requirement to tie the fentanyl taken by the victim to the person charged.
Its not enough to prove they sold fentanyl Givens said. We have to prove they sold the fentanyl to the victim that it was their fentanyl that resulted in death rather than fentanyl they may have gotten somewhere else. That was the defense Jemel Foster tried to use and the jury didnt buy it.
THE HUMAN COST
The human cost in lives and heartbreak of loved ones left behind is inestimable. Marti Riley of Marion lost her 22-year-old daughter Laura Jane Riley known as Lolly to a fentanyl overdose on March 26 2021. She said Lolly had begun suffering migraine headaches some time before her death but was unable to obtain prescription remedies for her condition.
I think she started getting illegal pain meds Riley said surmising that the path her daughter traveled that led to her death began with the debilitating headaches that left her desperate to find relief. In the months before Lollys death Riley said she began noticing some behavioral changes.
It wasnt anything I could put my finger on she said. I was trying to get her into a rehab and she wouldnt go she was an adult and wouldnt commit.
Despite urging from her two brothers and her sister Riley said her youngest daughter could not be persuaded to seek help.
On March 26 2021 Riley said she had taken some things for her daughter to Lollys West Memphis apartment.
I started banging on the front door and no answer so I walked around to the back and started banging and no answer she said. I thought maybe shed walked to Walmart because she didnt have a vehicle  so I left and went to the gym and I hadnt been there 10 minutes when the police called me.
Riley described her daughter as kind and considerate to everyone.
She was a beautiful girl inside and out Riley said. She loved babies and if there was one in the room thats where she was.
EVERYBODYS FRIEND
Laura Sipes of Cabot lost her son Jordan Michael Laughy to a fentanyl overdose at the age of 27 on April 29 2020. She said Jordan had struggled with addiction for years after the brother of a girlfriend introduced him to heroin several years before.
I know he smoked some pot in high school and got in trouble for it the normal stuff Sipes said.
He met a girl from Batesville and that really changed his life. Her brother was a heroin addict and he introduced it to my son. After that Jordan said I cant go back I dont know how to go back. I cant stop thinking about it. I want it all the time.
Sipes said she and her husband stuck by their son sending him to rehab and monitoring his progress and ironically she said at the time of his death Jordan appeared to be getting things together. But she said during a visit to Cabot to see his two children and their mother he was offered  and accepted  heroin that turned out to be laced with a lethal dose of fentanyl.
I found him that morning and tried to do CPR but it was too late she said. Then we discovered it was fentanyl and it had been put into what he thought was heroin.
Despite her sons struggles with addiction Sipes said Jordan was a devoted father to his two children and an outgoing and friendly person.
Jordan was everybodys friend she said. If you needed anything hed give you the shirt off his back. He had this light about him and everybody loved him.
JUST ONE PILL
Cassandra Flowers of Rogers said the feelings she has experienced since the death of her daughter Cassie at the age of 28 on Oct. 1 2020 are something any parent should be able to understand.
Do you have children Flowers asked. Thats all you have to know right there. If youre a parent she trailed off then continued angrily Whats happening with fentanyl is  its messed up.
Flowers said that both Cassie and her twin brother Alex had always cautioned her about making sure all of her prescriptions were properly stored in the original prescription bottles and about taking any drug of unknown origin. But Flowers said Cassie had struggled with depression since her teens and had become dependent on the anti-anxiety medication Xanax.
On that October day Flowers said Cassies young son Liam was staying with his father and Cassie staying at her parents home took what she believed to be a Xanax pill from someone she trusted. Flowers learned the truth when the medical examiners report came back.
The only things in her system were her Prozac some baking soda caffeine and enough fentanyl to kill four people. she said sadly. It wasnt even Xanax. It wasnt Xanax laced with fentanyl it was something that somebody made in their garage in a pill press to look like Xanax.
Flowers said she came home that evening to find her daughters body.
I came in and I just thought she was asleep in the recliner but she was dead Flowers said tearfully. I just miss her so much. She was so amazing.
Flowers said the stigma surrounding overdose deaths fails to take all the factors into consideration.
A teenager has been charged with murder after two teens died of a suspected overdose Tuesday in Fayette County.
Two teenage girls were found dead from a suspected drug overdose at a Fayette County high school late Tuesday afternoon according to Fayette County Public Schools. A third teenage girl was rushed to an area hospital in critical condition but was later upgraded to stable condition according to the Fayette County Sheriff's Office.
All three of the students one 16 years old and the others age 17 attended Fayette-Ware High School and were completing their junior year at the high school Fayette County Public Schools released in a statement on Wednesday.
Fayette County District Attorney Mark Davidson confirmed that the girl who has been charged was the third girl who was hospitalized following the incident. The teenager has been charged with two counts of second-degree murder and one count of possession of a controlled substance. All charges have been filed in juvenile court.
All three students were found in the parking lot of the high school hours before the graduation ceremony was slated to begin in the school's gymnasium.
The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is also investigating the circumstances around the students' deaths along with the Fayette County Sheriff's Department.
While overdoses and overdose deaths have increased over the last decade in Fayette County similar to every other Tennessee county and U.S. state overdose fatalities are still not necessarily common in the county. With a population of around 43000 according to data from the Tennessee Department of Health 19 people have overdosed and died in the county in 2021  the latest year for which data is available.
The rise of overdose deaths in Fayette County Tennessee and the U.S. overall is largely driven by the prevalence of synthetic opioids like Fentanyl. While it is too early in the investigation to know for certain Davidson said that this incident clearly appears to be related to a drug overdose and that there are signs pointing to fentanyl.
We have not seen to my knowledge 16- to 17-year-olds dying from fentanyl in my district and this is an extremely alarming development Davidson said. What I've been saying to people is if you buy any drug off the street you think your buying meth you think your buying cocaine you think you're buying a pressed pill or ecstasy or Xanax or whatever there's a real chance that it's got fentanyl in it. And it can kill you. So if your getting drugs that are not from a pharmacy you are placing yourself at risk of serious harm or death.
Vigil planned
A balloon release in honor of the victims has been planned for 5 p.m. Thursday in the rear parking lot of Fayette-Ware Comprehensive High School.
We encourage everyone to keep the friends and families of these young ladies and Fayette County Public Schools in your thoughts and prayers the school district said in a written statement released Wednesday.
Davidson said they are trying to start a drug free coalition in Fayette County similar to one that they already have in Tipton County that focuses on educating youth on drugs as well as issues like vapes cigarettes and underage alcohol.
We've been watching the numbers of overdoses we've been sufficiently alarmed Davidson said. We've already been doing public service campaigns and if you look at my Facebook you'll see where I've been doing it for about a year. It's just very troubling and it's sad that despite those efforts here we are today talking about this case.

MEMPHIS Tenn. A man who filmed a couple who had overdosed on heroin and were lying unconscious on a Memphis sidewalk as people mocked them is defending his decision to post the video live on Facebook.
According to police the two people said they snorted some heroin in a nearby Walgreens bathroom reports CBS station WREG in Memphis.
At one point in the video Courtland Garner puts his phone inches from the womans face. He and others in the crowd can be heard laughing at the pair. A driver who was passing called 911 and emergency responders were able to revive the married couple.
Garner is unapologetic saying he wasnt the first person on the scene and knew someone already had called for help. He told The Associated Press he shared the video to alert children to the dangers of doing drugs.
The video has been viewed nearly 3 million times.
Man passed out on Memphis street FacebookCourtland Garner
Many people who commented online criticized Garner for sharing it. He should have offered the couple assistance they said instead of sharing the moment on social media.
Garner said children might benefit from watching the video.
I hope one child who sees this video will realize how silly doing drugs makes you look he said. Theyll have that image in their head for life so theyll never want to touch a drug like that because theyll know the results.
What they were doing was children things. It was a spectacle. It made me laugh. They can help themselves said Garner. I know for a fact all the kids are on social media and when kids see that video you know what they are going to say I dont want to look stupid like that I dont want to do those drugs he told WREG.
Carla Hiers 59 and her 60-year-old husband Ronald told police they snorted heroin in a nearby drug store bathroom before they were found on the street said Memphis Police Officer Louis Brownlee. The couple was taken to a hospital and survived the incident. Carla Hiers was taken into custody after police discovered an outstanding warrant on a theft charge and several driving offenses Brownlee said.
Two telephone numbers listed for her were not working Friday.
Memphis police are encouraging people to notify authorities if they believe someone has overdosed.
We have to show compassion instead of recording things Brownlee said. We have to take an active role and do whats right and get people the help they need.

Sgt. Therman Richardson right and Lt. Webb Kirkdoffer discuss how MPDs homicide division works. Patrick LantripDaily Memphian
The high toll of homicide With the death of a 12-year-old in Westwood Monday night and the Tuesday death of a woman shot Sunday the City of Memphis flew by a milestone we all knew was approaching a record high number of homicides. Memphis previous record year for homicides was 2016 what is troubling now is not just the sheer number of deaths but the amount of time we have left until the end of the year. The increase means that homicide investigators are literally working around the clock one talked about going out on a case at 5 a.m. one day by the time he got back to the office later three or four more cases had come in.
Beauty and pain Obviously were just taking things day-by-day but the county went two days without any new coronavirus-related deaths  and yesterdays additional COVID-19 case count was fewer than 75. Not that its time for a victory lap. Shelby County Health Department Director Alisa Haushalter said yesterday that pandemic-related confinement and anxiety have almost certainly impacted a lot of things noting the rise in homicides see above opioid deaths drug trafficking suicides and divorce filings. In other news the county still has about 400000 left in grant money for close-contact businesses and is expanding the program to all beauty professionals.

FedEx scion Richard Smith isnt sure theyll stop there especially when it comes to increased pay We might ... have to take that higher just because of the demand for team members the demand for labor is so elevated both because of the ship-a-thon peak as well as the vaccine distribution we know is coming.
Events can return elsewhere and Santa will be a no-show As of today most of the state of Tennessee is essentially back to business and free of any caps limiting the size of gatherings. Gov. Bill Lee removed the restrictions yesterday but they dont apply to Shelby County and the other five counties with their own health departments. Those counties are being encouraged to follow suit but in Collierville for instance where leaders are busy planning the annual Christmas in Collierville event theyre not expecting the local gathering restrictions to be lifted. So Santa wont be at the gazebo this year and instead of the annual parade and celebration on the Square the town is coming up with other ways to make the season special.

Taylor Stamps says he kind of grew up in a goldfish bowl. Not only was Collierville pretty small at the time but Stamps father was the towns mayor from 1950-1955. And although Stamps never wanted to be a politician hes now a Collierville alderman if only for a few months. He was appointed in August to the seat once held by the late Tom Allen maybe in part because he doesnt want to keep it and will be reappointed to the towns Industrial Development Board once someone else is elected to serve.

By reducing the supply of potentially addictive medications and addressing the misuse of prescription pills before it starts were hopeful we can prevent deaths from substance use including fentanyl-laced counterfeit prescription pills said Williams.

MEMPHIS Tenn.  Last week we told you about an organization Flanders Fields that buys blighted properties fixes them and allows those facing addiction and homelessness to live rent-free.
Since we brought you that story last week Flanders Fields has officially started construction on their first home give a second chance to those battling addiction. Those in that South Memphis community said they are seeing more problems with overdoses mainly from Fentanyl.
Im one of the lucky ones that was saved from here said Big Red a Memphis resident. Luck has its eye on others. Big Red is known in her South Memphis community.
I lost a lot being out here in these streetsI went to jail every FridayI lost a lot going to rehab about 20 times and getting out doing the same thing. I just got tired. I just got tired said Big Red.
She was addicted to drugs. Now she is clean. Each day she helps try to keep her neighborhood drug-free. What she has seen lately is overdoses from fentanyl. Theyre mixing that stuff with any and everything. The whole month Ive lost about six or seven people a whole month off of fentanyl said Big Red. People are dropping like flies.
Since the beginning of this year Memphis Police Departments Heroin Overdose Response Team has investigated 120 non-fatal opioid-related overdoses and 23 possible deaths. Nearly all are due to fentanyl.
John Cox works with Flanders Fields a nonprofit fixing blighted homes for those facing addiction and homelessness. Over of the last year I know of well over 100 that have passed away due to fentanyl said Cox.
He carries an Opioid Overdose Reversal Kit every day in case he runs into someone who needs it. Ive had guys that have worked for me when I was doing construction. Theyll come in one day and be gone the next. Im just tired said Cox.
He battled addiction as well. When he started recovery years ago fentanyl was becoming popular. When I was in my active addiction I saw somebody die. Then watched the people take his dope to do it too. It kills all hope. It destroys from the inside out said Cox.
That is why Cox helps others with recovery as well. Its an evil. Its definitely an evil. It takes good souls said Cox.
Big Red and Cox said its important to find solutions to save lives. If everybody would unite said Cox.
Im trying to make a difference. Im trying to help like somebody helped me said Big Red.
The contributing factors behind the overdose spike are not clear but the trend is concerning said Alisa Haushalter Shelby County Health Department Director.

To be honest with you when I'm at work I don't really like talking about this stuff. I just get an eerie feeling because I feel like the spirits might be listening and I feel like I'm disrespecting them or something. It's crazy I know but I don't know how to explain it.
I've been working at Earnestine  Hazel's for 13 years yes ma'am. If you ever come in I'll still be here. I'm like a fixture on the wall here. I started working here at the end of 2001. I love it. I'm originally from Memphis born and raised.
The Earnestine  Hazel's building originated in the late 1800s when it was built as a church. Then it was a pharmacy and sundry store and then an old jazz café and brothel before it became a bar so there's a lot of unsettled spirits in here. The brothel was upstairs. Earnestine's husband owned the club and all of the jazz musicians used to hang out here. Ray Charles used to stay upstairs and do heroin and mess with prostitutes.
I never went here except one time before I started working here. Even before I started working here the place is known for its famous Soul Burgers. I used to sell the burgers to Russell. I worked at a meat market for six years and he told me that if I ever wanted a job to come by. I had never worked in a bar beforeI was freaked out in that big old bar by myself.
Earnestine and Hazel who were sisters came here in the mid-1950s and then Russell George reopened it in St. Patrick's Day 1993. Hazel died in 1995 but Earnestine she didn't die until 1998. She and Russell became really good friends. She told him all the stuff about the place and they used to hang out. But having worked here we've experienced it. Russell who was the previous owner committed suicide upstairs a year ago. He made that place what it is today.
It's mainly been upstairs that I've dealt with except downstairs the jukebox sometimes comes on periodically and plays songs at randomand this happens all the time you can ask my customers thiswe'll be sitting here talking about something and the jukebox will blare on a song pertaining to whatever we're talking about.
I feel like whatever's in here will take care of me because I've been here so long I respect the place. There was this guy who used to work here for 15 years. He went upstairs one day and I swear he came running down through the bar out the door all the way home. He will not go upstairs to this day. He saw something in here that scared him to death man. He couldn't explain what it was.
I heard through the grapevinethough I'm not sure if it's truethat some of the prostitutes were killed upstairs. I'm pretty sure all the spirits are women. I never really studied any of that stuff and I never believed in it until I worked here. But there's no doubt in my mind there's something in this building.
Weird stuff happens here all the time though. I've been here by myself and heard the piano playing upstairs. Sounds like people are wandering around talking up here. All those rooms from the brothel are still upstairs. Paranormal types are always up here spending the night. You can't take a picture up here without getting an orb in it. They're everywhere.
Another time a paranormal was in here talking about exorcism and stuff with Russell and all of the sudden the song by the Rolling Stones Sympathy for the Devil started playing on its own I swear. I think the only time I really got scared was when I was standing at the jukebox and it felt like somebody touched me.
One time my coworker and I were talking about James Brown on the day that he died. All of the sudden the jukebox blared on out of nowhere scared me half to death and started playing I Feel Good.
I've also had people making fun of the place. One nightthis is a true storysome people were sitting at the bar making fun of ghosts and talking trash about Earnestine and Hazel. All of the sudden the lights started getting brighter dimmer brighter dimmer until it was as bright as sunshine in here. They freaked out and left.
You can hearevery now and thenvoices. You can't really make out what they're saying but people are talking. Everyone used to think that the cleanup guy we had for years was crazy because he'd say that as soon as he'd walk in certain rooms they'd say Here he is again. But I definitely believe it after being working here for 13 years. Not a doubt in my mind.
Sometimes you can take pictures and you can see faces in the walls. Heck I've got customers who go upstairs with their little gadgets and stuff. I've been up there when they've had their flashlights on and when I come in they're saying Karen's here Karen's here and the flashlights start going on and off. That's when I get up and leave you know.
I've had all kinds of weird experiences with money too. One time we had a money bag go missingcouldn't find it looked everywhere. Then one Friday literally five years later I was shooting pool with one a coworker and it was dead as heck at the bar. I knocked the cue ball of the table and it rolled underneath a couch. We picked up the couch and underneath it laid a money bag with cobwebs and stuff all over it. I called Russell and he's like I have no idea where that came from. The next Saturday another coworker was shooting pool. Same thing happenedknocked the cue ball off and it went under the couch. We picked up the couch up and in the exact same spot was the money bag that had been missing for four or five years. I've had all kinds of weird experiences with money too.

You might not really want to hear this last story but it's a true story and this was when I knew something was in here. You might not really want to hear this last story but it's a true story and this was when I knew something was in here.
Like I said I've been working here a long time. In 2007 my 24-year-old son got killed. I was at work and found out that he had gotten shot. To make a long story short this was how I knew that EarnestineI think it's Earnestinewas watching out for me. When I came back to work I was sitting at the end of the bar by myself and I was crying. I said God please give me a sign that my kid's alright. Like I said I've been working here a long time. In 2007 my 24-year-old son got killed. I was at work and found out that he had gotten shot.

A judge in Tennessee was indicted Wednesday on charges of coercion of a witness and harassment records show.
Judge Andrewnetta Melissa Boyd 59 was booked into the Shelby County Jail in Memphis on Wednesday and released after posting 5000 bond. According to the complaint obtained by the Memphis Commercial Appeal Boyd is accused of pressuring her campaign manager to recant the statements she made to a judicial oversight body about Boyds use of marijuana and cocaine since taking office last year. Boyd also would show up at the campaign managers home and berate her the Commercial Appeal reported.
Boyd reportedly told the campaign manager to shut up and to not mess with her because shes a judge.
The judge elected in August 2022 as Division IX judge of the 30th Judicial District Criminal Court in Memphis took a leave of absence in May to address an illness. But in reality documents reviewed by LawCrime say she was suspended by the Tennessee Board of Judicial Conduct that oversees judges. The board suspended her on May 22 for no more than six months the documents said. The suspension appears to be tied to her criminal case.
On Nov. 30 2022 the board received a complaint alleging she was threatening and intimidating an acquaintance and that she was abusing alcohol. Boyd was required to respond in writing but missed the deadline by more than a month the document said. The investigation was expanded in March after Boyd was discovered sitting outside the acquaintances residence around 230 a.m.
During the incident Judge Boyd texted pictures of this individuals property and sent text messages which accused this person of having someone in the home investigators wrote.
Boyd wrote to the board on April 10 where she admitted to sending the text messages and acknowledged that it was inappropriate. She also admitted she had failed to respond to the board in a timely fashion blaming it on the deaths of several family members.
Then the board said it was expanding the investigation a third time after Boyd allegedly admitted to having a substance abuse problem. Boyd acknowledged to the board on May 5 that she did indeed have a substance abuse problem.
Boyds behavior was not appropriate the board wrote.
When any judge but especially a judge who adjudicates substance abuse or chemical dependency related matters such as Judge Boyd has alcohol andor substance abuse issues respect for the judiciary and the administration of justice suffers the board wrote. Clearly the public is more likely to respect and have confidence in the integrity and quality of justice administered by a judge if the judge has complied with the same standards of conduct he or she is responsible for applying to others. A judge who has drug or alcohol dependency issues does not inspire such confidence.
The board ordered Boyd to submit to a substance abuse evaluation and go to rehab if necessary. The Tennessee Lawyers Assistance Program which assists those in the law profession had to determine whether she was fit to return to the bench.
But the Board of Judicial Conduct on Oct. 31 issued a public reprimand of Boyd saying she failed to complete the substance abuse evaluation. It was her second reprimand of the year In May the board reprimanded her for asking for donations via social media for a school while wearing her judge robe which is a violation of judicial policy.
With the two reprimands in such a short time she was a judge the board referred Boyd to the General Assembly which can issue harsher penalties on judges including removal from the bench. Her attorney Michael Scholl did not immediately return a call for comment.
Prior to being a judge Boyd was an attorney when she also was accused of misconduct. She was suspended a year in 2015 when she allegedly mishandled a clients trust account.

Dr. George C. Nichopoulos Elvis Presleys personal physician in the decade before his death in 1977 who lost his medical license for overprescribing addictive drugs for years to numerous patients died on Wednesday in Memphis. He was 88.
Memorial Park Funeral Home in Memphis announced his death in a post on its website.
Dr. Nichopoulos known as Dr. Nick was the doctor on call at a medical center in Memphis in 1967 when he was summoned to treat Presley at his home Graceland. The singer was suffering from saddle sores on his thighs and buttocks caused by too much horseback riding.
Doctor and patient struck up a rapport and for the next few years whenever Presley flew in from Hollywood Dr. Nichopoulos treated him for a variety of complaints most related to insomnia and rheumatic pain.
After Presley returned to Memphis permanently in 1970 Dr. Nichopoulos became his primary physician and something more. I was one of his closest friends he told the investigative reporter Gerald Posner for a 2009 article in The Daily Beast. At times I was his father his best friend his doctor.
