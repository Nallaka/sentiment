For the first time Hayden Panettiere is opening up about a secret addiction to opioids and alcohol that nearly cost her career  and her life.
I was on top of the world and I ruined it the former Nashville star 32 says in the new issue of PEOPLE. She spent years battling her addiction as well as a devastating bout with postpartum depression. I'd think I hit rock bottom but then there's that trap door that opens.
Eventually Panettiere  who shares a 7-year-old daughter Kaya with her ex Wladimir Klitschko  was determined to get help. I put a lot of work into myself and I had to be willing to be incredibly honest says the actress who underwent both trauma therapy and inpatient treatment within the last year. Now she's returned to set to reprise her fan-favorite character Kirby Reed in the next Scream film and she's pouring her heart into her work with Hoplon International the charity she founded in March whose mission it is to raise funds for Ukraine as the country endures its fifth month of war with Russia.
This hasn't been easy and there were a lot of ups and downs says Panettiere of her journey to sobriety and happiness. But I don't regret even the ugliest things that have happened to me. I feel incredibly accomplished. And I feel like I have a second chance.
Already a star by the age of 11 after roles on soap operas and in Remember the Titans Panettiere says she was just 15 when someone on her team began to offer her happy pills before she walked the red carpets. They were to make me peppy during interviews says Panettiere. I had no idea that this was not an appropriate thing or what door that would open for me when it came to my addiction.

Panettiere was drinking alcohol and occasionally taking opioids but meanwhile her career was flourishing. My saving grace is that I couldn't be messy while on set and working says the star who landed the role of superpowered cheerleader Claire Bennet on Heroes when she was 16. But things kept getting out of control off set. And as I got older the drugs and alcohol became something I almost couldn't live without.

In 2014 Panettiere was starring as troubled country singer Juliette Barnes on Nashville. The actress's real-life pregnancy was written into the show and soon it became clear that her character's inner demons mirrored her own.
For more on PEOPLE's cover story with Hayden Panettiere listen below to our daily podcast PEOPLE Every Day.
Those were really tough years says Panettiere who suffered from severe postpartum depression after Kaya was born. I could relate to a lot of those storylines like the alcoholism and postpartum depression. They hit close to home.
Panettiere sought treatment for her depression but still found herself struggling  and increasingly independent on alcohol to get through the day.
I never had the feeling that I wanted to harm my child but I didn't want to spend any time with her says Panettiere who didn't drink during her pregnancy but fell off the wagon after Kaya was born. There was just this gray color in my life.
The actress would sneak away to drink and her relationship with Klitschko whom she began dating in 2009 began to crumble. He didn't want to be around me she recalls. I didn't want to be around me. But with the opiates and alcohol I was doing anything to make me feel happy for a moment. Then I'd feel worse than I did before. I was in a cycle of self-destruction.
At her lowest point I would have the shakes when I woke up and could only function with sipping alcohol says Panettiere. In 2018 the year Nashville ended the actress made the heartbreaking decision to send Kaya to live with Klitschko from whom she had split in Ukraine. It was the hardest thing I ever had to do she says. But I wanted to be a good mom to her  and sometimes that means letting them go.
The drinking worsened and eventually Panettiere was hospitalized suffering from jaundice. Doctors told me my liver was going to give out she recalls. I was no longer a 20-year-old who could just bounce right back.
Eventually Panettiere entered rehab for eight months. She credits her stay for giving her the tools to get over the hump of her addiction but it wasn't until recently that the actress says she's finally found the peace she yearned for so long.
It's an everyday choice and I'm checking in with myself all the time says Panettiere. But I'm just so grateful to be part of this world again and I will never take it for granted again.
I had never seen death the way I've seen death when it comes to opioid addiction says Thomas Gooch a recovery counselor in Nashville Tenn. On his phone Gooch displays a picture of his wife who died of an overdose.
In one way or another Thomas Gooch has spent more than 30 years struggling with illegal drugs. The 52-year-old Nashville Tenn. native grew up in extreme poverty. He was first incarcerated in 1988 and spent the next 15 years in and out of jail for using and selling narcotics. Until 2003 Gooch says. That was the first time I went to treatment and the last time I used. Since then for most of 19 years Gooch has been trying to get others into recovery or just keep them alive. He handed out clean needles and injection-drug equipmentwhich reduce injuries infections and overdose deathsin Nashvilles hardest-hit communities. In 2014 he founded My Fathers House a transitional recovery facility for fathers struggling with substance use disorder.
But despite Goochs long experience the opioid epidemic recently has brought a level of devastation to the Black community that has shocked him. I had never seen death the way Ive seen death when it comes to opioid addiction he says. Theres been so many funerals it doesnt even make sense. I personally know at least 50 to 60 individuals who died from overdoses in the last 10 years. That staggering body count includes Goochs recently estranged wife in 2020 and a former partner in 2019.
A million people in the U.S. have died of opioid overdoses since the 1990s. But the faceand raceof the opioid epidemic has changed in the past decade. Originally white and middle class victims are now Black and brown people struggling with long-term addictions and too few resources. During 10 brutal years opioid and stimulant deaths have increased 575 percent among Black Americans. In 2019 the overall drug overdose death rate among Black people exceeded that of whites for the first time 36.8 versus 31.6 per 100000. And with the addition of fentanyl the synthetic opioid thats 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine Black men older than 55 who survived for decades with a heroin addiction are dying at rates four times greater than people of other races in that age group.

The reasons for this dramatic change come down to racial inequities. Research shows that Black people have a harder time getting into treatment programs than white people do and Black people are less likely to be prescribed the gold standard medications for substance use therapy. If you are a Black person and have an opioid use disorder you are likely to receive treatment five years later than if youre a white person says Nora D. Volkow director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health. Treatments are extraordinarily useful in terms of preventing overdose death so you can actually recover. Five years can make the difference between being alive or not. Black people with substance use problems are afraid of being caught up in a punitive criminal justice system and are less likely to have insurance good enough to allow them to seek help on their own. And the COVID pandemic disrupted many recovery and harm-reduction services particularly for people of color.
Gooch blames straight-out racial discrimination in the health-care system too. When we call different places to try to get people into treatment the question they ask is What drug do they use he recounts with exasperation. If you say crack all of a sudden they aint got no bed available. If you say opioids and heroin they will find a bed because thats the demographic they want. A couple of times I told patients that the only way theyre going to get help is to get drunk and turn themselves into Vanderbilt Hospital because Vanderbilt will hold them for five days and thatll get them into treatment.
Gooch is one of the people trying to improve access to therapies for addiction and change the overall dysfunctional dynamic. Other groups are bringing more effective addiction treatments within prison walls reducing the chances of recidivism on release. A proposed federal law would make therapy with the commonly used addiction medication methadone less onerous for an impoverished population as well as less stigmatizing. And Volkow is using her platform at the NIH to highlight the overwhelming research-based evidence for better ways to understand and treat addiction.
Access to Treatment
The nations historic reluctance to treat addiction as a health-care issue rather than a criminal justice one has resulted in a health-care system where too few people of any racejust 10 percentreceive treatment for substance use disorder. Several factors such as stigma and an inability to afford or access care make the numbers considerably more dismal among people of color. Even after a nonfatal overdose Black patients are half as likely to be referred to or access treatment as non-Hispanic white patients according to federal government data.
A growing recognition that criminalization and incarceration do little to curb illegal drug use or improve public health or safety has led to harm-reduction policies such as Good Samaritan lawsstatutes that provide limited immunity for low-level drug violations and increase availability of naloxone a drug that can reverse overdose. But racial disparities have emerged in the application and effectiveness of both measures. A study from RTI International found that Black and Latino intravenous drug users have inequitable access to the medication.
Loftin Wilson program manager for the NC Harm Reduction Coalition in Durham N.C. who has worked in the field for more than a decade says the problems with inequality lead to distrust in the system which creates a vicious cycle in which people who need help wont go to institutions that can provide help. People entering treatment worry with good reason that dealing with the social service system can cause them to lose their employment housing or even custody of their children. Thats another example of the negative experiences people who use drugs have. They definitely dont land equally on everybody and people dont experience them all the same way. It is a vastly different experience to be a Black drug user seeking health care than for a white person Wilson says.
University of Cincinnati psychologist Kathleen Burlew notes as Volkow does that when Black patients enter treatment they are more likely to do so later than white people and are less likely to complete it. In addition to mistrust she says the less favorable outcomes result from factors such as clinician bias and lack of racial and ethnic diversity among treatment providers.
Federal resources such as grants to support local opioid use disorder clinics and programs also tend to favor white populations. According to 2021 data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 77 percent of the clients treated with grant funding were white 12.9 percent were Black and 2.8 percent were Native American. The disparity is even more pronounced in some states. For example in 2019 North Carolina announced that white people made up 88 percent of those served by its 54-million federal grant compared with 7.5 percent for Black people. Native Americans accounted for less than 1 percent of those served.
Medication Inequality
Research has shown that there is a bias among health-care providers against using medication-assisted treatment MAT which combines FDA-approved drugs with counseling and behavioral therapies. Substance use specialists consider it the best approach to the opioid use problem. Yet a study published in JAMA Network found that about 40 percent of the 368 U.S. residential drug programs surveyed did not offer MAT and 21 percent actively discouraged people from using it. Many addiction treatment programs are faith-based and see addiction as a moral problem which leads to the conclusion that relying on medication for abstinence or sobriety simply trades one form of addiction for another. Many general practitioners who lack training in addiction medicine have this misconception.
The three medications approved by the FDA are buprenorphine methadone and naltrexone. Buprenorphine and methadone are synthetic opioids that block brain opioid receptors and reduce both cravings and withdrawal. Naltrexone is a postdetox monthly injectable that blocks the effects of opioids. Very few insurance providers in the U.S. cover all three medications and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the full range of medications is far less available to Black people.
Research suggests that economics and race influence who receives which medications. Buprenorphine for instance is more widely available in counties with predominantly white communities whereas methadone clinics are usually located in poor communities of color.
To use methadone patients must make daily visits to a clinic to receive and take the medication under the supervision of a practitioner. This requirement makes it difficult to do things that build a normal life such as attending school and obtaining and maintaining a job. There is also the stigma of standing in a public line known to everyone passing by as a queue for addiction treatment. The treatment model was developed during the Nixon administration based on racism and a stigmatized view of people with addiction without any thought of privacy or dignity or treating addiction like a health problem says Andrew Kolodny medical director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative at Brandeis University. The stigma is made worse by methadones classification as a Schedule II controlled substance which is defined as a substance with a high potential for abuse potentially leading to severe psychological or physical dependence. This categorization pushed the medication into a quasicriminalized status and the clinics into minority communities.
Buprenorphine however is a completely different story. When opioid use problems increased in white communities Congress acted to create less stigmatizing treatment options. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 DATA 2000 lifted an 86-year ban that prevented treating opioid addiction with narcotic medications such as buprenorphine which today is sold under the brand names Subutex and Suboxone. The majority of doctors who got special federal licenses to prescribe it accept only commercial health insurance and cash so the drug is usually offered to a more affluent population which in the U.S. means white people. About 95 percent of buprenorphine patients are white and 34 percent have private insurance according to a national study of data through 2015.
John Woodyear is an addiction treatment specialist in Troy a small rural town in south central North Carolina where the epidemic is exacting an increasingly heavy toll on the Black and Native American populations. Overall overdose death rates increased 40 percent from 2019 to 2020 but death rates among those two groups in particular went up 66 and 93 percent respectively. Yet Woodyear who is Black and practices in a town that is 31 percent Black says his patients are 90 percent white. People come to the clinic through word of mouth or referrals from friends. As long as Woodyears patients are mostly white new patients will be mostly white as well he says.
One exception to this racial pattern is Edwin Chapmans clinic in the Northeast neighborhood of Washington D.C. one of the districts predominantly Black and most impoverished communities. Chapman a physician often prescribes buprenorphine to his patients with opioid use problems and the overwhelming majority of them are Black. He says that to prescribe the drug physicians like him must get past certain roadblocks. The insurance companies in many states put more restrictions on patients in an urban setting such as requiring prior authorization for addiction treatment he says. Further to increase the dose above 16 or 24 milligrams you may have to get a prior authorization. The dosing standards were based on the white population and people who were addicted to pills. Our surviving Black population often needs a higher dose of buprenorphine.
Chapman says few physicians in private practice are willing to treat these patients. They dont really feel comfortable having these patients in their office or they arent really prepared to deal with the economic and mental health issues that come with this population he explains those disorders include bipolar disorder and schizophrenia among others.
People have their own biases that keep them away from medication such as buprenorphine Wilson says. Many view it as simply trading one drug for another. They think If Im going to take this step why not just go to detox and not take any medications at all he says. Theres a big cultural misunderstanding about the fact that these medications are the only evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder. Short-term detox isnt the most appropriate intervention for most people.
Gooch agrees that the bias is real. He facilitates recovery groups at a program operated by a group from Meharry Medical College a historically Black institution. Yet I havent seen one Black person yet Gooch says. Some think its a setup. Theres so much distrust they have a hard time thinking its legal. Its just the culture of Black people. Many are religious and think taking the drug is wrong.
Those misconceptions are holdovers from our having been miseducated from the outset Chapman says. Whites have done a tremendous job educating their community that this is a medical problem a disease. In the African American community drug addiction has always been and continues to be seen as a moral problem and incarceration was the treatment.
Hope for Change
In the November 2021 issue of Neuropsychopharmacology Volkow argued that it is long past time for a new approach to drug addiction that would address these misconceptions within the most affected populations and biases among providers. We have known for decades that addiction is a medical conditiona treatable brain disordernot a character flaw or a form of social deviance she wrote.
Volkow argues that treatment reform should start with prison and the criminal justice system. Even though there is no difference along racial lines in who uses illegal drugs Black people nonetheless were arrested for drug offenses at five times the rate of white people in 2016. The racial disproportionality in incarcerated drug offenders does not reflect higher rates of drug law violations only higher rates of arrest among racial and ethnic minorities. Currently the number of arrests for heroin which more Black people use exceeds the arrests for diverted prescription opioids which more white people use even though the latter is more prevalent.
These unequal arrests and incarcerations add to the racial inequalities in drug treatment and survival rates. An estimated two thirds of people in U.S. correctional settings have a diagnosable substance use disorder and approximately 95 percent will relapse after their release. In the two weeks postrelease the risk of overdose increases more than 100-fold and the chances of death increase 12-fold.
Paradoxically that makes prisons and jailsinstitutions with the most obvious and overt racial disparitiesthe places with the greatest potential to bring about effective change. Volkow points to a recent NIH study as proof that starting substance disorder treatment during incarceration lowers the risk of probation violations and reincarcerations and improves the chances of recovery. But only one in 13 prisoners with substance use problems receives treatment according to a Pew data analysis.
Some local programs have started to tackle some of these issues. In Pittsburgh the Allegheny Health Networks RIvER Rethinking Incarceration and Empowering Recovery Clinic opened in May 2021. Its goal is to reduce recidivism among people with addictions by providing care for the formerly incarcerated immediately on their release from jail regardless of their ability to pay. Since opening the clinics caregivers have engaged with hundreds of people.
New York City recently became the first municipality in the country to sanction overdose prevention centers where people with substance use disorder can use drugs under medical supervision. Two sites one in East Harlem and the other in Washington Heights opened in December 2021. They have had more than 10000 visits and prevented nearly 200 overdoses by administering the medication naloxone.
There are other signs of change too. California signed a law that requires every treatment provider in the state to provide a client bill of rights to notify patients of all aspects of recommended treatment including no treatment at all treatment risks and expected results. And federal authorities loosened methadone regulations during the pandemic. Instead of daily in-person visits more patients were allowed to use telehealth consultations and take doses home. Senators Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Rand Paul of Kentucky have introduced a bill that would make that change permanent. Among other programs and initiatives across the country these are an indication that drug treatment policy may be headed in a more equitable evidence-based direction.

NASHVILLE Tenn. The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services is excited to welcome Mary Shelton as the Executive Director of Tennessees Opioid Abatement Council.
As Executive Director Shelton provides day-to-day leadership management and oversight for the functions of the Council directly supports Council members and will supervise Council staff. She was selected by a unanimous vote of the Councils membership at their first meeting on July 8 2022.
Tennessee's Opioid Abatement Council was created by the Tennessee General Assembly in Public Chapter 491 to manage the disbursement of proceeds from lawsuits relating to opioids. The Council upholds the responsibility to ensure the disbursements of these funds go toward funding programs strategies expenditures and other actions designed to prevent and address the misuse and abuse of opioid products and treat or mitigate opioid use or related disorders or other effects of the opioid epidemic.
We are so excited to have Mary Shelton join our team to lead this important new initiative. Her attention to detail organization and communication skills will be essential in ensuring that the Opioid Abatement Council is able to live up to its mission and get funding into Tennessee communities that have been so greatly harmed by the opioid crisis said TDMHSAS Commissioner Marie Williams LCSW.
I cant think of anyone who is better positioned than to lead in this work than Mary Shelton. What she brings from a Medicaid standpoint and understanding the issues and challenges that we face in the delivery of care to this population will exponentially increase our ability to improve the lives of people who have been touched by opioid addiction said Opioid Abatement Council Chair Stephen Loyd MD.
Shelton has significant experience in behavioral health working previously with TDMHSAS and most recently at TennCare managing mental health and substance use services for the states Medicaid beneficiaries. She is a 26-year state employee with an undergraduate degree from Tennessee Technological University a graduate degree from Trevecca Nazarene University and is currently pursuing a Master of Public Health at East Tennessee State University.

Now to the opioid crisis in the United States.
President Trump addressed the issue today with a team of advisers meeting in New Jersey. It's a problem touching all corners of the country.
As the mayor of Nashville Tennessee Megan Barry has dealt with an increase in the number of overdose deaths in her city.
But last month it took a very personal turn.
Lisa Desjardins has more.
The growing concern over opioid abuse has prompted both the federal government and many states to address concerns over referrals for substance abuse treatment. Tennessee recently addressed the issue in House Bill No. 2068 which took effect July 1 2018 and significantly impacts the marketing and referral practices of providers of alcohol and drug treatment services. Additionally on October 24 2018 President Trump signed into law a new sweeping bill aimed at the opioid crisis which also targets marketing and referral practices. This alert has a targeted focus on the new Tennessee law but updates on the federal law are forthcoming.
With a few minor exceptions the law impacts anyone who provides alcohol and drug services in Tennessee including the following licensed providers 1 alcohol and drug services providers licensed under Title 33 of the Tennessee Code Annotated 2 health care providers such as physicians nurses physician assistants and psychologists licensed under Title 63 and 3 health care facilities including hospitals licensed under Title 68.
The law generally prohibits four types of conduct by alcohol and drug services providers 1 making false or misleading statements about the provider's identity products goods services or geographical locations in marketing materials 2 including any false information or electronic links coding or activation on a website that provides false information or that surreptitiously directs the reader to another website 3 soliciting or receiving or attempting to solicit or receive a commission or kickback in return for a referral to or from a provider of alcohol and drug services and 4 entering into an arrangement with a marketing provider who agrees to generate referrals through a call center or web-based presence provided that this may be acceptable if certain disclosures are made to the patient. It is unclear exactly what type of conduct regulators will target under the marketing-related prohibition but a general review of marketing materials and website content is warranted in light of the new law. Additionally this is a good time to review all relationships with referral sources to ensure such arrangements do not present risk under the new law.
Penalties for violations of the law vary depending on licensure of the offender. In general the range for civil penalties is 250 to 5000 per violation. Perhaps more importantly all violations can lead to suspension or revocation of the provider's license regardless of which Tennessee regulatory authority issued the license.
Of key importance to note the new Tennessee law and the new federal law both demonstrate the focus on cracking down on a wide variety of marketing practices. Unlike many other health care fraud and abuse laws prohibited conduct under the new Tennessee law and the new federal law is not limited to marketing or referrals involving beneficiaries of governmental programs. These laws have general application to all types of patients including private pay and those covered by private insurance. Therefore all providers of alcohol and drug treatment services need to be aware of the changing landscape in this area and review both their marketing practices and any commission or incentive programs to ensure compliance.
If you have questions on how this law will affect your operations please contact Layna Rush or any member of the Baker Ober Health Law Group.
 -- Nashville Mayor Megan Barry said Sunday that her only child 22-year-old Max Barry has died of an apparent drug overdose.
An emotional statement released by the mayor and her husband Bruce Barry said their son died in Denver on Saturday night.
Early this morning we received news that no parents should ever have to hear. Our son Max suffered from an overdose and passed away. We cannot begin to describe the pain and heartbreak that comes with losing our only child. Our son was a kind soul full of life and love for his family and friends the statement said. Our family would greatly appreciate your thoughts and prayers and would respectfully ask for privacy as we mourn the loss of our child and begin to understand a world without his laughter and love in our lives.
Max Barry graduated in June from the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma Washington. It is unclear what exactly he overdosed on.
Funeral arrangements were pending as of Sunday and will be announced once plans are made the mayor's office said.
With her husband and son by her side Megan Barry was sworn in as Nashville's first female mayor in September 2015.
Denver Police Department spokeswoman Raquel Lopez declined to search the department's records and logs for the police report of Barry's death when asked by The Associated Press saying that would violate the department's policy of not identifying victims.
According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more than half a million people in the United States died from drug overdoses from 2000 to 2015. The majority of drug overdose deaths involve an opioid a type of drug often used to relieve pain.
The United States is in the midst of an opioid overdose epidemic with 91 Americans dying each day from an opioid overdose. Opioids including prescription opioids and heroin killed over 33000 people in 2015 more than any year on record. Nearly half of all opioid overdose deaths involve a prescription opioid according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Companies that made distributed or sold opioid painkillers faced lawsuits that led to a 26 billion settlement. In 2022 local governments across the country  including in Tennessee  signed on to the settlement agreement and now its up to the affected communities to decide how they will best mitigate the damage those companies caused.
In 2023 more than 700 Nashvillians died from a drug overdose.
In March of this year the Tennessee Opioid Abatement Council announced 81 million in grant awards statewide with millions set to hit Nashville organizations bank accounts starting in July.
There are a few common threads in the program strategies. Medication-assisted treatment with buprenorphine and methadone curbs opioid cravings. It is used to treat opioid use disorder shortened to OUD and substance use disorder SUD a broader term. Naloxone commonly known by the brand name Narcan can reverse an overdose but not if xylazine an adulterant often found in illicit drugs is involved. Many organizations will operate under the harm-reduction ethos which acknowledges that people will not typically be ready to quit using drugs altogether but when provided with clean syringes wound care and naloxone they can more likely live to one day access treatment.
Below find more details on how Nashvilles top five awardees plan to spend the opioid-abatement money.
Vanderbilt University Medical Center 2.8 million
VUMCs funding will focus on treatment for mothers with substance use disorder and their babies bolstering the organizations 2011-founded Firefly program.
Theyll use the opioid-abatement money to expand services to rural areas. Patients travel to VUMC representing 26 different counties says Jessica Young medical director for Firefly. The organizations goal is to get pregnant mothers into treatment so Firefly can minimize the effect on the fetus provide specialized anesthesia during birth and continue to support patients postpartum.
The opioid-abatement money will also be used to employ more peer recovery specialists with the hope of growing the profession Young says.
We have found adding peer recovery specialists to our team has really increased engagement Young says. We have fewer people who are disengaged from care. For people who do relapse I think it makes it easier for them to re-engage.
3 Nashvilles Co-Response Programs Round Out REACH pilot program releases Q3 results Partners in Care to expand to all police precincts
Mental Health Coop 2.3 million
Mental Health Coop with 12 locations statewide currently has a small grant that allows them to serve a handful of uninsured individuals per month. With the additional funding the organization will be able to serve more of them in medication-assisted treatment outpatient treatment and detox offerings. Detox offerings are difficult to find in the region and are a barrier to other forms of treatment.
To make sure people are prepared to have outpatient treatment means sometimes they need to go through detox first says chief operating officer Andrea Westerfield. Not many of those services exist across the state and our goal would be to use our 247 crisis services here in Davidson County to be able to also complete detox on site and have a safe place to do that.
Meharry Medical College 2.6 million
Dr. Lyle Cooper director of the Meharry Addiction Clinic finds that very few people with substance use disorder actually come into the clinic. Because of this much of the organizations opioid-abatement money will go toward establishing a mobile clinic in Memphis to mirror the one in Nashville.
HOPE Clinic Helping Our People Effectively started as a mobile syringe exchange program and thanks to the funding will now include fentanyl test strips xylazine test strips naloxone wound treatment HIV and hepatitis-C testing and treatment plus prescriptions for medication-assisted treatment.
Though the smallest subset of the cash just over 429000 is going to research called Tennessee Harm Reduction Efforts for Advanced Data THREAD its the part Cooper is possibly most excited about. THREAD will include a point-in-time survey and create an advisory board to allow people with substance use disorder to participate in research studies.
We know how many people go to treatment every year Cooper says. We have some idea of what the outcomes are in treatment and how many people overdose and we know some things about those folks  whether its fatal or its nonfatal. The space where we just dont know much of anything is people who are actively using drugs.
Belmont University 2.9 million
Belmont University is entering the opioid landscape for the first time with a harm-reduction program called BU Trains. The program is twofold offering training for students and current physicians as well as a mobile unit that will provide care similar to Meharrys model along existing routes for the citys outreach workers.
With Belmonts medical college set to welcome students this fall the timing is ripe. BU Trains will also serve as a teaching opportunity for the students.
We dont want to reinvent the wheel thats for sure says Tracy Frame an associate professor of pharmacy and medicine at Belmonts future medical college. We want to partner with organizations and really help everyone flourish.
Were growing says pharmacology professor Amy Henneman. Theres a sense of Where can we be helpful to Nashville We want to be an integral part of the community.
Metro Nashville Public Health Department 2.1 million
Metro Nashville Public Health Department will use the money to expand its opioid pilot program for which it is set to announce the awardee in May once approved by the Metro Council.
The program will implement an opioid care process that employs a care coordinator to guide the person through treatment including housing and transportation resources where needed. Referrals will come from the citys REACH program the emergency room and incarceration reentry as well as self-referrals from the departments clinics.
When he spotted his 11-month-old daughter she had white residue on her lips.
She was having difficulty breathing  her body battling a mixture of cocaine and fentanyl  close to becoming one of the youngest overdose victims in Nashville.
The child was treated at Centennial Medical Center's Children's Hospital. She is expected to make a full recovery.
Dozens arent so lucky.
Fatal drug overdoses in Nashville declined during the first quarter of 2023 but still netted 93 confirmed deaths with 49 pending. During the first three months of 2022 officials counted 193 fatal overdose deaths.
Related emergency room visits dropped slightly during the same period  from 525 2022 to 499 2023. Also three out of four overdose-related toxicology reports during the first quarter of 2023 contained fentanyl.
1999-2021 Child deaths nationally from fentanyl increased
Nationally the picture is more grim. One recent study published in JAMA Pediatrics found that child deaths from fentanyl increased sharply between 1999 and 2021. Fifteen years ago 5 of opioid deaths in children were caused by fentanyl according to the study. By 2021 fentanyl was responsible for 94 of such deaths that study found.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reported earlier this year that overdose deaths from fentanyl jumped 279 from 2016 to 2021.
How Nashville is getting serious about overdose deaths
The medical emergency in Nashville came to the attention of local authorities when the father informed them that his daughter pulled a piece of paper from a bathroom garbage can and placed it in her mouth. He initially denied responsibility for the fentanyl then later admitted to purchasing the illegal narcotics and discarding them in the home.
Officers located a straw on a living room table and a lottery ticket with a white powdery substance still on it.
Officials notified the Department of Childrens Services which provided services to the childs mother she was not present at the time her daughter ingested the fentanyl. This investigation is ongoing.
This case and others explain why Nashville is getting serious about curbing overdose deaths especially along Lower Broadway where 30 bars including Whiskey Row and Frank Sinatra Lounge now store Naloxone also known as Narcan an opioid reversal medication on-site.
Also Gibson Gives a charitable organization under Gibson Guitars launched TEMPO Training and Empowering Musicians to Prevent Overdoses. The program places the kits which cost around 350 in Nashville music venues.

The overdose problem in Tennessee the lives were losing the families that are torn apart thats not someone elses problem. Thats all of our problem said TDMHSAS Commissioner Marie Williams LCSW. We want to reduce the stigma of addiction and celebrate the courage that it takes to say I need help. Substance use disorder happens to people in all walks of life for any number of reasons but the hope of a new life in recovery is real. We see it every day.
We stand in unity with our State partners and all who have a stake in advocating for compassion education and harm reduction in combatting the tragic toll of substance misuse said State Health Commissioner Ralph Alvarado M.D. F.A.C.P. Let us recommit ourselves to the joint effort that is needed to save lives reduce stigma and create a healthier community state and world for all.
Drug overdoses continue to impact far too many families in our state said TBI Director David Rausch. Today and every day Im grateful for our partners who continue to do everything we can to try to tackle this crisis from all sides. We cant do it alone though. If you need help get it. And if you know someone struggling with addiction do everything you can to convince them to take their first steps toward healing. Doing so might just save a life.
As many lives as have been lost to overdose tens of thousands of Tennesseans have been saved thanks to the hard work of the Regional Overdose Prevention Specialists. Since October 2017 the ROPS have distributed more than one million doses of naloxone and trained hundreds of thousands of Tennesseans on how to reverse an opioid overdose and save a life.
Hayden Panettiere has been open about her struggles with addiction to alcohol and opioids since she came forward in 2022  after years of battling the disease. Her life also became fodder for tabloid headlines as she weathered through her mental health issues postpartum depression and a tumultuous relationship with her ex-fiancï¿½ Wladimir Klitschko. But there are many more layers to her story and its heartbreaking to hear.
Much of the 34-year-old actrress difficult time happened while she was starring on Nashville playing Juliette Barnes a rising superstar in the country music industry. While she loved playing the character and the opportunity it gave her in Hollywood she also described it to The Messenger as very traumatizing because I felt like I was acting out my own life. Panettiere began to notice that her personal struggles became the main storyline for her role. Related story Hayden Panettiere Is Making Moves in Her Hollywood Comeback With This Major Project
NASHVILLE Hayden Panettiere Charles Esten in Fire and Rain Season 5 Episode 511 aired March 9 2017. CMTCourtesy Everett Collection.
Straight from the beginning it was like Im dating a football player and then Juliette dates a football player. And then they turned her into an alcoholic Panettiere noted. Then they turned to her leaving her daughter and going to this crazy place in Europe and it was very obvious  They werent doing their homework. They werent creating new storylines. Those blurred lines were pretty confusing because they gave the Heroes star no relief from the burdens of swirling life.
They were just looking at my life and going Oh lets just take what shes going through and put our little spin on it. And then ta-da Its done and done she added. The long days on set resulted in her mental health declining rapidly. I didnt have time to take care of myself and to think about and go through the pain I was experiencing physically and emotionally Panettiere explained. She had to relive her daily struggles on and off the set. I was like tear central. I dont even think on a soap opera that I cried as much as I did on Nashville she said.
Panettiere first shared her struggles with her fans in 2022 after she revealed that her years as a child star caused enormous pressure. Her heavy drinking began in her early 20s as a way to self-soothe. I was being told how to be and how to live by so many people in my life she told Womens Health. I wanted certain decisions to be my own and nobody could stop me. What I put in my body was like an act of defiance.
After the birth of her daughter Kaya in 2014 the downward spiral took on a frenetic pace as her PPD and opioid addiction added another layer to her problems. By 2018 her on-and-off battle with substance abuse led to her losing custody of her daughter to Klitschko which she described to Red Table Talk as the most heartbreaking thing shes ever faced.

NASHVILLE Tenn.  The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services TDMHSAS is receiving more than 53 million in additional funding from the federal government to address post-COVID mental health and substance use needs.
The supplemental block grant funding will add more than 27 million to mental health services and nearly 26 million to substance use services over the next four years. The funding is part of a 3 billion allocation included in the American Rescue Plan signed into law in March.
The new funding comes on top of significant supplemental funding from the federal government and new investment of state dollars. TDMHSAS has received an additional 55 million in COVID relief funding from the federal government since the start of the pandemic and Governor Bill Lee and the Tennessee General Assembly increased the departments budget for next fiscal year by more than 44.1 million.
The most recent rounds of federal funding supplement the states existing Mental Health Block Grant and Substance Abuse Block Grants. New dollars will expand the availability of evidence-based treatment services strengthen the statewide network of crisis services support the continued and expanded use of telehealth services respond to the unique needs of children and more. TDMHSAS and federal partners are both allowing room for mental health and substance use treatment agencies across the state to design programs that meet their communities unique needs.
With the outpouring of support for mental health and substance use needs in our state we have a priceless opportunity to bring about significant change and make a difference for Tennesseans who are struggling. The mental health and substance use impacts brought on by the stresses of the pandemic are with us and these generous investments at both the state and federal levels are going to make sure we and our community behavioral health providers can continue to rise to meet the need said TDMHSAS Commissioner Marie Williams LCSW. We are tremendously grateful to our amazing network of providers across the state who answer the call and respond with compassionate care to help people find new lives in recovery.
During the pandemic the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveyed people in Tennessee and across the nation on feelings of anxiety and depression. Tennesseans self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression at rates of more than 40 which is more than double the normal prevalence of any mental illness in a given year.
Tennessee also saw a tragic spike in drug overdoses in the first few months of the pandemic. Thanks to the work of the Regional Overdose Prevention Specialists and other harm reduction groups the rate of drug overdose returned to normal levels but still too many Tennesseans are dying from a preventable cause.

A sedative drug used for animals is now showing up on the streets of Nashville causing public health concerns.
The mitigations of Xylazine is starting to show up as the cause of death in autopsies as well as in drug busts Metro Police's top drug officer says. The drug is meant to be used as a sedative for animals such as cattle and not approved for human consumption.
The issue with this new drug is you can't override the affects of it with Narcan like you can with other drugs. Xylazine can reportedly leave open sores and even cause the removal of limbs if it doesn't take you life first.
One Metro Council member said he saw the effects of this drug first hand when he visited a homeless camp in his district.
I've recently had a homeless camp closed in my district says Metro Councilmember Jordan Huffman. And I have seen what Xylazine does to the human body first hand. Going in these camps and seeing the decay and the loss of limbs is extremely traumatic. Not only just or those who see it but my goodness the people that have to deal with it.
Metro Police Sergeant Mike Hotz says about 80 of the fentanyl tested in their crime lab tested positive for Xylazine. He notes the amounts the lab saw were traced meaning Xylazine is present in the drug supply but not necessarily in quantities large enough to have the narcotic effect to get a person high.
Unfortunately in my personal and professional opinion the Xylazine is here on scene in Nashville's drug supply and that poses significant public health and public safety issues to our citizens says Sergeant Hotz. And it creates not only a problem for treatment of substance use disorder but it also creates other public health problems with the open wounds.
Sergeant Hotz says Metro Police believes Xylazine is coming in from the Southern border from places like Mexico and Central America. It is being sold along with fentanyl as well as mixed in with drugs such as meth.
Xylazine has been on the State of Tennessee's radar since 2022 according to Metro Police. Now it is being seen in areas across Nashville.
Doctors at Vanderbilt Medical University Center have been made aware of this new public health issue. They appreciate Metro Police informing them of the problem so medical professionals can start collecting data on how best to treat the significant wounds.

NASHVILLE Tenn.The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services TDMHSAS announced that its Regional Overdose Prevention Specialists ROPS distributed 35000 units of naloxone across the state from October 2017 to present. More than 14000 of the units were distributed directly to law enforcement.
The ROPS are regionally-focused community trainers who work in their assigned areas to educate people about substance use disorder opioid overdose and the use of naloxone. Since the program began in October 2017 ROPS have held 1450 trainings reaching more than 32000 people statewide. Trainings are targeted to people at risk of overdose community groups that interface with people at risk of overdose and first responders.
The only way to misuse naloxone is to not use naloxone. Its the only antidote to opioid overdose and it saves lives said TDMHSAS Commissioner Marie Williams LCSW. If we can prevent an opioid overdose from taking a persons life we can truly give them a second chance at seeing the hope that lies ahead in recovery from addiction.
The ROPS program has documented more than 2000 lives saved as a result of naloxone distributed through the program. The department believes the actual number of lives saved is higher than reported for a number of reasons including the stigma of addiction.
Because of the success weve seen with the ROPS and with new funding and support from our federal state and local partners weve recently increased the number of ROPS covering the state from 13 to 20 said Taryn Sloss TDMHSAS Assistant Commissioner for Substance Abuse Services.
NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  The family of a toddler who died of fentanyl poisoning is now suing the Nashville facility where she was found.
The Community Care Foundation manages Highroads Place in Nashville and both are listed as defendants in the lawsuit filed by the grandfather of Ariel Rose.
The Rose family is now seeking 15 million in damages.
Ariel was 22 months old when she was found unresponsive at Highroads Place last November.
Her father was staying at the transition home at the time but says he left the toddler in the care of a Jane Doe for one night.
Metro Nashville Police said thats when Ariel was exposed to fentanyl and died of fentanyl poisoning.
An autopsy report showed Ariel had enough fentanyl in her system to kill multiple adults.
Although Jane Doe is listed as a defendant in the lawsuit attorneys say that the Rose family believes Highroads Place shares in the liability.
According to the lawsuit there were more than 145 calls made to Metro Nashville Police between January 2022 and when Ariel died in November of that year.
Attorney Isaac Kimes said most of these calls involved drug abuse of some kind and some were fatal.
We highlighted the fact that there had been more than 100 calls made to this facility. Many of those calls dealing with calls and not just that but there were actually dead bodies found in the facility dealing with drug overdosebefore Ariel ever stepped foot at Highway Kimes said.
Highroad Place serves as a transition home for people trying to get back on their feet from any number of things.
In the case of Ariel and her father both had been living in the now-former Brookmeade homeless encampment.
Thats where many first learned about the toddler who was spotted by police on one occasion living in a tent just feet from an exposed syringe.
Ariel later moved in with her aunt but was eventually reunited with her father at Highroads Place.
The lawsuit claims that the Community Care Fellowship knew people were using drugs in their residences.
The lawsuit goes on to say the defendants should have known about drugs circulating through their facility but the family believes they did nothing to stop it.
When asked about any liability shared by the family for leaving Ariel in the care of someone with a known history of drug abuse attorneys said that the family wants those who facilitate the drug use held responsible.
We want to be preventing those situations from happening. We have an opioid epidemic across the country that we all know about. In this situation that epidemic made its way into a place where drugs are not supposed to be Kimes said.
Community Care Fellowship sent us the following statement
We send our sincerest sympathies and condolences to the family. As this is an ongoing legal matter were not in a position to publicly comment on specific details related to the complaint. CCF has cooperated with police authorities in their investigation of this matter. We will engage in the legal process to address the civil complaint being made against our organization.
Metro Nashville Police have ruled Ariels death as negligent homicide but no one has been arrested.

Max Barry son of Nashville Mayor Megan Barry died from a combination of several drugs including opioids according to an autopsy report released Wednesday by the Jefferson County Coroner's Office in Colorado.
Drugs found in Max Barry following his death were Xanax marijuana and two opioids  liquid methodone and hydromorphone. The autopsy also showed that he had recently used cocaine.
Max Barry 22 died at a home that a friend was housesitting on Saturday July 29 in Littleton Colo. a suburb of Denver where he had moved after college. He was there with two friends.
The toxicology findings confirm what the mayor called an apparent overdose immediately after his death. She had speculated that her son was killed by a combination of a drugs including Xanax.
There was no alcohol present in Max Barry after his death according to the autopsy report. Contributing factors to his death were hypertension and obesity.
The mayor and husband Bruce Barry have chosen to be transparent about the death of their only child to become a voice in the growing national opioid crisis. Max Barry had past struggles with drug addiction and enrolled in a drug rehab facility last summer for one month.
The mayor after returning to work Monday and discussing the tragedy with local media has been on a national media swing this week to discuss opioids and her son's battle with drugs.
She appeared on CNN with Jake Tapper and PBS NewsHour on Tuesday and on MSNBC's Meet The Press Daily with Chuck Todd and NBC Nightly News on Wednesday.

The list of priorities for lawmakers as they convened in Nashville last week for the start of the legislative session was lengthy.
Of those one of the topics likely to get the most attention this session is how lawmakers address the states growing opioid crisis.
According to state Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Service estimates 284412 Tennessee adults used heroin andor opioid pain relievers non-medically in 2016. Another 33325 Tennesseans ages 12-17 did the same.
Rep. Eddie Smith R-Knoxville has made it his goal this session to pass legislation geared toward helping the latter population by implementing recovery high schools schools that serve teens struggling with using drugs and alcohol across the state.
This is affecting everybody it doesnt matter your socioeconomic class Smith said about the crisis. Its affecting everybody across the board. This year we saw the son of the Nashville mayor pass away because of this. It doesnt matter if youre rich poor black or white everybody is affected by this. This is an issue.
Overall at least 1631 Tennesseans died from drug overdoses in 2016 up 12 percent from the 2015 but experts think the reported number is low due to inconsistencies in how counties investigate and report deaths.
How the schools would work
The high schools would be set up as non-residential treatment facilities that combine counseling and drug treatment with a high school curriculum. The high schools would serve as an option for parents wanting their child to get help and give juvenile court judges another tool in their tool belt.
Students would be dropped off and picked up like a normal school but the days may be a little longer than a normal school.
Hellen Ross McNabb regional vice president Mona Blanton-Kitts said the organization and Knox County Schools spent a good portion of 2017 before Smiths proposed legislation researching recovery high schools with the thought of possibly starting one in Knox County.
It allows the child to receive both a quality education and good treatment without having to sacrifice one or the other 
Credits would be transferable and diplomas would be from the school they were originally set to graduate from Smith said.
We dont want the stigma of a recovery high school to follow them into their career path in the future he said.
Recovery high schools can be effective
Andy Finch is an assistant professor of counseling and researcher at Vanderbilt University. Finch served as the former school director at Community High School a recovery school in Nashville that closed in 2008 and is considered a national expert on recovery high schools.
He said he is impressed and excited that state lawmakers are beginning to study the schools.
I would say with some confidence that the program is likely to work for a family in many different ways  my feeling is the peer support that is present in a recovery high school is the most important factor. We cant say that imperially but its something that the recovery high schools provide that really no other setting is going to provide he said.
In a 2017 published study Finch found recovery high school students were twice as likely to report complete abstinence from alcohol marijuana and other drugs 59 percent to 30 percent at their six month follow-up than students who did not attend a recovery high school.
Likewise in preliminary analysis for a not yet published study Finch said high school graduation rates for recovery high school students is at least 20 points higher than those who do not attend a recovery high school for at least 30 days.
Blanton-Kitts was thrilled that the state was beginning to look at recovery high schools because they work she said.
What we know is long-term treatment is much better than short-term treatment and treatment in the community and environment especially in a school-based setting is much better than taking a child out of the environment if possible.
What works best is them not going back to the same environment where the same triggers are she continued. If there is a recovery high school to go to it would extend their sober living and would continue their treatment they have been in.
Finch said there are around 40 recovery high schools across the country and only one in Tennessee Ridgecrest Academy in Nashville.
Ridgecrest had two students with the USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee wrote about it in the fall of 2016 and Finch said he didnt think the school had any students currently. Administrators at Ridgecrest could not be reached for comment.
The reason Community High School failed and Ridgecrest has struggled is due to the cost to families Finch said. Any cost to families is a barrier he said. Ridgecrests tuition was 25000 in 2016 and Community High Schools was around 12000 when it closed.
A lot of families have already spent money on treatment for kids  theyve already spent thousands on treatment and counseling services and medication Finch said.
Smith's proposal is for public recovery schools not private.
Making a dent
Under Smiths proposed legislation the state would set up three recovery high schools one in each grand division and would pull county state federal and grant funding to open the schools.
He expects the plan to cost about 100000 a year per school a figure that could rise but he points to Department of Mental Health figures that show the state spent 50.9 million in state and federal funds in fiscal year 2018 on adult substance abuse treatment but just 3.2 million on adolescent treatment plus another 170000 for Juvenile Recovery Court.
The proposed legislation does not stipulate how many employees would be needed but Smith said he imagines current school system employees would make the move to the school. The proposed legislation assumes existing facilities would be used.
Weve got to do more to reach our kids Smith said. Were throwing money at the back end of the problem. We need to be throwing it at the front end.
Of all the things we could fund with knowing we have a surplus going into the next year and going into the future this is one area where putting money is well worth the investment for what it will do Smith continued.
Knoxvilles Metropolitan Drug Commission Executive Director Karen Pershing agreed.
Either we intercept the problem in the early years when the behaviors start or were going to pay a whole lot more when theyre adults and the consequences will be a whole lot greater for all of us she said.
The state will receive that money over 15 years as part of the larger 17.3 billion in agreements that will be split between more than a dozen states.

NASHVILLE Tenn.  Tennessee will receive more than 400 million over 15 years after Walgreens CVS and two drug manufacturers agreed to finalize settlements to resolve lawsuits that alleged the companies contributed to the opioid crisis in the U.S.
The money will come from a much larger 17.3 billion in combined agreements involving more than a dozen states. Tennessee joined a broad coalition of states and thousands of local political subdivisions to reach settlements with five companies CVS Walgreens Walmart Allergan and Teva.
Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said a final agreement with Walmart hasn't been announced yet because of different processes for finalizing the settlement which he said is expected to happen in the coming weeks.
The four companies that finalized their agreements will also be required to follow certain rules as part of the settlement. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries is being required to halt any opioid marketing and ensure it has systems in place to prevent drug misuse. Drugmaker Allergan will be required to halt sales of opioids for the next 10 years.
CVS and Walgreens have agreed to require its pharmacies to monitor report and share data about suspicious activity with opioid prescriptions.
Skrmetti said the money is expected to start flowing to state and local governments by the end of 2023 which will be used to fund programs for things such as evidence-based opioid treatment and recovery services expanding overdose-reversal drug education for communities and preventing the over-prescription of opioids.
This court-ordered injunctive relief will help ensure a crisis like this does not happen again he said.
To date Skrmetti said Tennessee has received more than 1 billion from these opioid settlements.
In February the TOAC announced county governments would receive the first round of payments from the JansennJJ settlement agreements. 35 of the money is being paid out directly to counties in the form of opioid abatement trust funds while the remaining 65 will be distributed to communities through a competitive grant application process overseen by the TOAC. The state council said it is still trying to develop the application process for grants so it is not currently accepting any applications.
Story highlights Max Barry died last month in Littleton Colorado Mayor says frank talk resources needed to fight epidemic
CNN 
Max Barry the 22-year-old son of Nashville Mayor Megan Barry died last month from an accidental drug overdose complicated in part by morbid obesity an autopsy report said Wednesday.
He had several drugs in his system at the time of his death including methadone THC cocaine alprazolam and hydromorphine according to the Jefferson County coroners report.
The report said he also had other health problems including hypertension fatty liver disease and fatty deposits in two of his major arteries and a reported history of prescription drug abuse with withdrawal symptoms.
Since her sons death on July 29 in Littleton Colorado Barry has spoken openly about his struggles with drugs saying that transparency may help others confront similar problems.
I cannot tell you how many people have come to me and shared their own grief stories about a loved one who died where they never talked about it before she told CNNs Jake Tapper in an interview on Tuesday. And I think that as a community we arent ever going to get in front of this epidemic if we arent actually having these kind of very frank conversations about whats killing our children.
Barry said that her son had gone to rehab last year.
He spent a month in rehab which was a great gift. We were able to make that happen for him and make it happen quickly because we had access to health care she said.
And actually that got him back on the right track she said. He went back to school. He graduated in his senior year this year and was headed to his next phase of life. He made a really stupid choice two Saturdays ago and its one he cant ever undo. 
Max Barry graduated from the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma Washington.
Asked about policies to treat drug addiction and combat the opioid crisis she mentioned the problem of overprescribing and the importance of a federal role in the fight. Barry spoke about her sons use of Xanax which is a trade name for alprazolam a drug used to treat anxiety.
She cited the importance of providing enough treatment beds and the need for first responders to be equipped with Narcan the brand name of naloxone  a drug used to help reverse overdoses.
We have to recognize that this is an epidemic and we have to make sure that those resources are out there she said.
New laws to combat the opioid crisis represent a game-changer in Tennessee according to an addiction recovery expert. The latest legislation makes it easier for residents and advocacy groups to obtain naloxone a medication that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose.
Why it matters Opioids particularly the potent synthetic opioid fentanyl continue to drive alarming numbers of overdose deaths in Nashville.
Tennessee is among the top five in the country for the rate of overdose deaths.
What they're saying Mary Linden Salter executive director of the Tennessee Association of Alcohol Drug  other Addiction Services told local officials the new law was one of the best things that we've been able to do to fight deadly overdoses.
By the numbers The Metro Council Public Health and Safety committee hosted a meeting last week analyzing opioid trends.
There are about 104 suspected overdoses per week in Nashville that require emergency medical response according to health department data.
There were 352 suspected overdose deaths in Nashville during the first half of the year.
Fentanyl was detected in more than 75 of those cases per the health department. The synthetic opioid can be added to counterfeit pills and other drugs without the user's knowledge.
Driving the news There has been a jump in the number of overdose calls where multiple doses of naloxone is needed suggesting more potent substances are creeping into the local drug supply.
State of play Salter who spoke at the committee meeting told the council a raft of new legislation passed this year would likely save lives in the face of those trends.
In addition to a law that makes it easier to get naloxone from a pharmacist legislators approved a law that allows people to get fentanyl testing strips and a law that requires providers to offer naloxone alongside most opioid prescriptions.
Former Mayor Megan Barry whose son Max died of a drug overdose in 2017 returned to the council chamber during the committee meeting last week.
In an emotional speech she urged city leaders and residents to fight the stigma surrounding substance abuse.
What she's saying Barry said she initially chose not to share information about her son's addiction in part because she wanted to shield him from judgment.
If we had treated this like a disease instead of a moral failure I believe Max would still be here today she told the committee.
If only we had known that our shame and guilt was preventing us from a deeper understanding of what was going to happen.
Flashback Barry has become an outspoken voice in the opioid crisis. But her return to the chamber where she served as an at-large council member for two terms before becoming mayor was noteworthy.
Barry resigned from office in 2018 as part of a deal with prosecutors after an affair with the head of her security detail became public.

In the first 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic a record number of Americans died from drug overdoses. Although months of data is still incomplete statistics show that most of the deaths involve the potent drug fentanyl.
According to the National Institute of Drug Abuse fentanyl is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. In the new series Poisoned which explores the devastation caused by fentanyl ABC News Live examines how many parents are learning the deadly reality of the drug only after their children have suffered a fatal overdose.
Tanja Jacobs spoke to ABC News Live. ABC
Romello Marchman grew up in Nashville Tennessee. His mother said that he was a typical 22-year-old man who loved video games and cars.
He was a young man like so many others out there said Tanja Jacobs. They are stressed they are worried. The pandemic keeps them away from their friends. They can't go to school.
During the pandemic Romello Marchman died from cocaine laced with fentanyl according to Jacobs.
He got it from his friends. And it's the only reason why he took it is because he did get it from his friends and he did trust them said Jacobs.
Last year Tennessee had the third highest overdose death rate in the country according to the National Institute of Drug Abuse.

In the Nashville area between 75 and 80 of our fatal overdoses will involve fentanyl at this point in time said Trevor Henderson the former director of the Nashville Overdose Response and Reduction Program.
That statistic accounts for the death of Frankita Davis.
Betty Davis said her daughter was diagnosed with cancer when she was 17 years old and that doctors had prescribed her pain medication. One day a friend offered her daughter a pain-reliever pill that they did not know was laced with fentanyl the mother said.

She chose to take a pill but she didn't choose to die said Davis.
Fentanyl which was originally made for sedation during surgery is one of the most powerful opioids ever created. Fentanyl-related fatalities began to skyrocket nationwide after drug dealers and cartels began to lace the chemical into drugs that they were already selling often targeting addicted users looking for a more powerful high according to the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.
A few grains of fentanyl will make you high. A couple more will kill you said Sam Quinones who authored a book on the U.S. opioid crisis. It's just so potent and so profitable Dealers are seeing that this is something they could sell in all manner of ways and to all manner of customers.
Candice Sexton a Nashville coroner keeps a growing list of people dying with fentanyl in their systems. In 2016 her office noted 102 deaths related to fentanyl in middle Tennessee alone.
Every year since those numbers have nearly doubled Sexton said.
Candice Sexton is coroner in Nashville. ABC
It was just mind boggling she added.
In 2021 Sextons office reported nearly 1200 fentanyl-related deaths. She said she expects 2022 to be even higher.
We are on track for it to be worse said Sexton. We have outgrown our cooler. We have a FEMA trailer that they're allowing us to use as well for additional storage.

In 2018 I remember people coming in for heroin said Bogard. Now nobody's coming in saying I'm here for heroin. People are walking in the door saying I'm here for fentanyl.
Naloxone otherwise known as Narcan reverses an opioid overdose. First responders said they are often administering multiple doses of Narcan just to resuscitate one person.
In Nashville Henderson leads a small team of five people monitoring the fentanyl epidemic. One of their main goals is to distribute Narcan in parts of the city that have high numbers of overdoses.
We can identify hotspots of activity. So we can look at ZIP codes that are hit particularly hard said Henderson.
Unfortunately the growing number of fentanyl-related deaths is not unique to Nashville but a scene playing out across the country. Like many other parents Jacobs has been trying to spread the word about the dangers of fentanyl.
She said she is against the use of the word overdose and prefers to use the word poison.
If you take too much of something you overdose. You might or might not die she said. But once that fentanyl is in there if you get something you havent asked for and then you die from it - it's poisoning which makes it a murder.

USA TODAY NETWORK - Tennessee
A suspected drug dealer in Nashville has been arrested on charges of second-degree murder and second-degree attempted murder after one man died and another suffered serious medical issues from fentanyl-laced heroin the suspect is believed to have given them.
Derrick Huey 18 of Meadow Court was arrested on the homicide counts Wednesday evening a day after being charged with selling heroin.
A police news release sent out Thursday said the charges against Huey are from the first prosecution of its kind but likely not the last.
East Precinct officers responded to a death call at 3 Fern Ave. on Jan. 26 and found James Roy Richardson Jr. 41 dead on the floor. Jack F. Delocatera 42 was found in the living room and told police he couldn't walk.
A white powder that field tested positive for heroin was found in Delocateras bedroom police said in the news release. Autopsy findings from the medical examiner showed that Richardson died from a lethal dose of fentanyl an extremely potent substance some suppliers mix with heroin.
Police said Delocatera said he purchased 50 worth of heroin and split it with Richardson. Detectives used cell phone information to identify Huey as Delocatera's suspected dealer. Huey later admitted to police that he sold cocaine and heroin in the area.
Huey is jailed in lieu of 100000 bond.
Police said investigations similar to the one involving Huey are continuing by Metro detectives.
Heroin interdiction continues to be a priority for the police department police said in the release. Dealers should know of the potential for overdose deaths becoming homicide investigations. Likewise users should be cognizant that any heroin they buy could unknowing to them contain an illicit form of fentanyl that is contributing to deaths across the nation.

Too many Tennesseans are dying of drug overdoses every year. In 2022  the most recent data available  3826 Tennesseans died a of a drug overdose. Of those deaths most involved an illicit illegal opioid fentanyl . With training and the opioid overdose reversal drug naloxone you can stop an overdose and save a life.
What is an opioid overdose
When too much of an opioid is taken it can slow breathing to a dangerously low rate. When breathing slows too much or stops an overdose death can occur. Overdose reversal medications displace the opioids in the brain and help the person to start breathing again.
Any time an overdose is suspected call 911 immediately and stay with the person until first responders arrive. Administer the overdose reversal medication naloxone if you have it. Additional doses of overdose reversal medications may be needed if breathing has not restarted after 2-3 minutes once a dose has been given. If substances other than opioids are involved additional medical attention may be needed.
Overdose reversal medications are proven tool against overdose death. The most common product used outside of medical settings is a medication called naloxone or known by one of the brand name products Narcan. Naloxone can be given through a nasal spray brand names RiVive Narcan and Kloxxado through an autoinjector brand name Zimhi or from a vial with syringe. Nalfemene brand name Opvee has also been recently released.
Overdose reversal medications are not dangerous are not addictive and have no potential for misuse. While training is no longer required for protection under the Good Samaritan Act training it is highly recommended so that people can recognize and respond to an overdose effectively and efficiently.
If you want to learn more about how you can reverse an overdose and connect to free training and resources for yourself or for a group please reach out to the Regional Overdose Prevention Specialist who serves your area. You can find their contact information at this link.

When two people died recently from drug overdoses about a mile from each other along the Murfreesboro Road corridor their test results showed the presence of xylazine a sedative used for horses and cattle.
On a hunch Metro Nashville police Sgt. Mike Hotz signed into the evidence room pulled out 120000 counterfeit pills seized last month and tested them.
They tested positive for acetaminophen  a common binder material  fentanyl and xylazine.
He tested another set of seized pills. They too tested positive for the veterinary drug.
That is a significant quantity of pills that was destined for the streets of Nashville Hotz said during a Metro Nashville Public Health and Safety Committee meeting Tuesday. I believe that it's important for the public as well as our public officials to understand that unfortunately in my opinion xylazine is here on scene in Nashville's drug supply.
Hotz tracks and monitors all fatal drug overdoses in the city and what he and his fellow officers are seeing is startling he said Tuesday. Almost every time the drug was working in concert with fentanyl Hotz said.
The Metro Public Health Department tracks data on all suspected drug overdoses in the city issuing quarterly reports of their findings.
The department first included xylazine in their 2021 fourth quarter report where it was found in 2.7 of overdose deaths about 20 cases more than doubling the number from 2020.
In 2022 the cases doubled again to 40 fatal overdoses involving xylazine and cases have remained steady according to the 2023 fourth quarter report.
MoreAhead of a Tennessee opioid trial lawyers squabble over a monkey named Carlos
But even with steady numbers Hotz raised serious concerns. In Pennsylvania and other places where the drug first emerged officials were not equipped to handle it which led to skyrocketing mortality rates Hotz said.
Xylazine can cause severe breathing issues blood clots damage to muscles nerves and kidneys as well as serious open wounds that have at times led to amputation of limbs Hotz said.
Council member Jordan Huffman who represents parts of Donelson and Hermitage noted during the meeting the impact the drug is having in his district.
I recently had a homeless camp closed in my district and I have seen what xylazine does to the human body firsthand he said during the Tuesday meeting. Going in these camps and seeing the decay and loss of limbs is extremely traumatic not only for those that see it but my goodness the people that have to deal with it.
It also can cause people to develop a dual addiction with fentanyl with which is it commonly paired. Narcan has no impact on reversing the side effects of xylazine.
Huffman asked if there is a treatment for the drug.
There is nothing approved for human use that reverses a xylazine overdose Hotz said. That will need professional medical intervention usually to include significant breathing treatments.
If you or someone you know needs help with addiction please call the Community Overdose Response Team for help at 615-687-1701. Anyone with information about drug sales in the city is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 615-742-7463.
Seven hundred and fifty four people died by drug overdose in the Nashville area last year a number that makes Davidson County the second-deadliest major metro in the country.
Fentanyl was linked to over 77 of those cases.
Overdose deaths have more than doubled since 2017 according to data kept by the Metro Public Health Department.
Davidson County has the second-highest rate in the country behind Baltimore for overdose deaths in metros over 5000000 people according to 2022 data compiled by the San Francisco Chronicle.
Shelby County was 12th in the country.
Drug overdoses have steadily risen each year in the United States since 1999 according to the CDC. In 2021 opioids accounted for 75 of those deaths.
Opioid drug overdoses hit the U.S. in three deadly waves each a consequence of the one before it.
Prescription painkillers became a leading cause of overdose deaths around 2000. When the pills became more regulated people started turning to heroin around 2007. Fentanyl began making its way into heroin around 2013 quickly becoming and remaining the leading cause of opioid overdoses.
The Chronicle in an effort to better understand the opioid epidemic created a tracker using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Here's what we learned from the drug overdose database.
Nashville-area sees most overdose deaths in Tennessee
Davidson County leads Tennessee in overdose deaths.
Shelby Knox Hamilton and Rutherford counties counted 608 532 233 and 113 deaths respectively in 2022 according to the data.
Roughly 100 people per 100000 died from an overdose in Davidson County last year.
Fentanyl accounted for 77 of those deaths. Cocaine was found in about 30 of cases while methamphetamine was found in 33 according to the health department's statistics for last year.
See how many overdose deaths were recorded in each county
Tennessee among top ten for overdose deaths in the U.S.
Tennessee is eighth in the country for overdose deaths according to the database. The CDC reported 3854 deaths across the state in 2022.
While fentanyl remains the predominate drug in overdose cases prescriptions painkillers were prevalent in just as many cases in 2021 as 2017 despite a dip in the middle years according to the Tennessee department of health.
In Tennessee over 4.3 million painkillers were prescribed in 2022 though that number has been declining since 2018 when about 6.1 million were issued.
Tennessee noted 645 cases where prescription opioids were the main drug about 17 of all overdoses according to the latest data available from the state.
Heroin peaked at 380 deaths in 2019 while fentanyl-related deaths have continued to climb since 2017 with about 74 contributed to the drug.
Here are the 10 states with the highest number of reported overdose deaths in 2022
California  11094 Florida  7675 New York  6412 Texas  5429 Pennsylvania  5201 Ohio  5141 North Carolina  4030 Tennessee  3854 Illinois  3831 Michigan  2956
Where to find help
Tennessee is abundant with recovery support services.
The state's Addiction Recovery Program serves residents who are at or below the federal poverty threshold through assessment case management spiritual support transitional housing employment skills and other services.
For those who regularly use or know someone who does having Narcan on hand can be a lifesaver.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March approved Narcan  the standard treatment to rapidly reverse the effects of an overdose  to be sold over-the-counter in pharmacies across the country.
Narcan hit the shelves last week.
The Nashville Prevention Partnership provides training on how to properly administer Narcan and care for someone who is overdosing.
There are also several syringe services programs across Tennessee that provide free sterile needles and syringes safe disposal containers testing and overdose prevention resources.
In Nashville Meharry Medical College and Nashville CARES both run clinics for safe needle exchange.
NASHVILLE Tenn.The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services TDMHSAS is encouraging all Tennesseans to look at the prescription medications in their homes and prepare to participate in National Prescription Drug Take Back Day this Saturday from 1000 a.m. to 200 p.m. local time.
National Prescription Drug Take Back Day is organized by the Drug Enforcement Administration to encourage the safe and secure disposal of potentially addictive and otherwise harmful prescription medications. In Tennessee community groups including the states Substance Use Prevention Coalitions team up with local law enforcement and other partners to host Take Back Day events. The events serve to collect thousands of pounds of medications while also providing opportunities to start conversations about preventing substance misuse and addiction.

It couldnt be easier to safely and securely dispose of the expired or unneeded prescription medications in your home. Just collect the medications youre ready to dispose bring them to an event and drop them offno questions asked said TDMHSAS Commissioner Marie Williams LCSW. By reducing the supply of potentially addictive medications and addressing the misuse of prescription pills before it starts were hopeful we can prevent deaths from substance use including fentanyl-laced counterfeit prescription pills.
Many people dont realize it but theft from medicine cabinets of family and friends is one of the most common and preventable forms of drug diversion said TBI Director David Rausch. This weekends event is a great opportunity for Tennesseans to take advantage of the numerous locations across the state to safely dispose of unwanted or expired household pharmaceuticals.
Prescription drugs that are not disposed of properly can end up in our waterways so DEA Take Back Day can have a positive effect both in terms of health and the environment said Commissioner David Salyers of the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation TDEC. This program helps in many ways and TDEC is proud to be part of it.
In the last National Prescription Drug Take Back Day in April of this year agencies collected more than 8200 pounds of medications at more than 120 locations across Tennessee. Since the start of Take Back Day Tennesseans have safely and securely disposed of more than 350000 pounds of medications.
Tennesseans who miss out on National Prescription Drug Take Back Day can still safely and securely dispose their medications at one of 383 permanent drug drop boxes across the state. These drop boxes are located in many pharmacies police precincts and sheriffs offices. Find a permanent drug drop box near you at this link tdeconline.tn.govrxtakeback
NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  Davidson County has the second highest overdose death rate in the country.
A new report by The San Francisco Chronicle looked at fatal overdoses across the country and found Davidson County was second only to Baltimore.
The report is from February 2022 to January 2023

Last year 754 people died from a drug overdose in Nashville according to the Metro Public Health Department. Fentanyl was the main driver in the increased number of drug overdose deaths. Other frequently detected substances in fatal drug overdose cases were meth and cocaine.
Virginia Sadler lost her grandson Jeremy Miller to fentanyl. The 80-year-old admits she didn't realize how powerful fentanyl is or how much of it is in our community until Miller died.
You can die immediately if it's in heroin or pills you take from somebody Sadler said. That was amazing to me that these pills that are out here and they look like everything else and they've got fentanyl and they kill you said Sadler.
Miller had just detoxed and completed treatment when he relapsed at a recovery house in Madison.
It's just so hard. I didn't go through it when I was growing up. I mean we didn't even know about drinking or any stuff like that... it was smoking and beer Sadler said.
Regional overdose prevention specialists with Nashville STARS told us that naloxone  the overdose reversal medication - is something everyone should carry. They say it's best to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it.
As for where someone is safest when they're recovering Andrea Hancock a peer counselor with STARS says a supportive living environment such as a recovery home or program. Those usually provide the support accountability and structure needed for someone who is in recovery.
All homes arent the same and all homes don't have the same guidelines. A family member or loved one should educate themselves on what options exist to find a safe place for a loved one to recover. That would include making visits and seeking referrals.
NASHVILLE Tenn.The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services TDMHSAS and Department of Health today issued new guidance and information around fentanyl and what to do in case of a potential exposure.
Recent media reports have highlighted stories of exposure to a white powdery substance assumed to be fentanyl and the wide variety of adverse medical reactions that followed. While these stories are disturbing it is important for everyone involved to separate fact from fiction when talking about fentanyl exposure to avoid unnecessary confusion and panic.
Illicit fentanyl cannot be absorbed through the skin or by touching an item or surface where it is present. When in powder form fentanyl and its analogs including carfentanil and fluorofentanyl cannot be absorbed through the skin. Dissolving the powder in a liquid does not change this property. Wet objects do not pose an increased risk for an overdose caused by casual exposure.
Its so important to separate fact from fiction when it comes to fentanyl because Tennesseans are dying of overdose by the thousands. It is our hope that these facts will help people who are struggling with opioid use reach to treatment if they need it and find a new life in recovery said TDMHSAS Commissioner Marie Williams LCSW.
Overdoses are heart-wrenching for those who live through them and for the family and friends of those who dont said TDH Commissioner Dr. Morgan McDonald MD FACP FAAP. We are taking every opportunity to provide care and information to those dealing with addiction to prevent deaths and overdoses from fentanyl and opioids.
What should you do if you believe you have been exposed to a substance that could be fentanyl
Do not touch your eyes nose or mouth.
Wash your hands with soap and water to remove any substance from your hands.
If you begin to experience any adverse medical symptoms seek medical attention.
Symptoms of opioidfentanyl overdose include pinpoint pupils falling asleep or losing consciousness slow and shallow breathing choking or gurgling sounds limp body and pale blue or cold skin. If you suspect an overdose call 911 and administer naloxone Narcan if available. Do not leave the person alone.
Symptoms such as alertness rapid heartbeat hyperventilating sweating chills numbness in fingers are NOT typically associated with opioidfentanyl overdoses though they may need medical attention. These symptoms are more commonly associated with anxiety or a panic attack.
For a fentanyl overdose to occur the powder must enter the bloodstream and get to the brain. This is why it is important to avoid touching your eyes nose or mouth until you can wash your hands. Fentanyl can also enter the bloodstream through cuts or wounds on the skin. Wounds must be open and visible to allow fentanyl to enter.
Prescription fentanyl transdermal patches dispensed by a licensed pharmacist are especially formulated to include other pharmaceutical ingredients designed to increase the permeability of the skin which allows a small amount of fentanyl to be absorbed very slowly. Full absorption of fentanyl through a patch takes 3-13 hours. Proper disposal of patches reduces the risk of ingestion by children and pets.

Former Nashville Mayor Megan Barry is considering a bid for Congress in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District challenging incumbent U.S. Rep. Mark Green R-Clarksville.
I'm exploring a run for Congress and will decide in the coming weeks Barry said in a statement to The Tennessean on Wednesday. I believe Mark Green has repeatedly ignored the needs of Tennesseans as rural hospitals close and more people die from overdose deaths. He supports extreme bans on abortion and he and Congress have done nothing about gun violence. He deserves to be challenged.
Since the Republican-majority state legislature re-drew congressional redistricting lines in 2021 carving Nashville into three GOP-dominated congressional seats Music City has not had a representative in Congress who resides within Davidson County.
Incumbent U.S. Rep. John Rose whose district includes parts of northeast Nashville lives in Cookeville while U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles who represents parts of Antioch and south Nashville lives in Columbia.
Barry a Democrat was the first female mayor of Nashville elected in 2015 after two terms on the Metro Council. During her administration Barry advocated for a business-friendly socially progressive agenda.
She resigned from the office in 2018 after pleading guilty to felony theft related to a nearly two-year affair with a former police bodyguard Sgt. Rob Forrest. Barry was sentenced to three years of unsupervised probation and agreed to reimburse the city for 11000 in unlawful expenses. After completing three years of successful probation the charge was expunged from Barry's record in 2021.
Despite the affair and her resignation Barry has remained a prominent and well-respected voice in Nashville politics and has advocated for addiction research among other topics. Her son Max died of an opioid overdose while she was in office.
The Nashville Banner first reported Barry considering a congressional bid.
Green is a physician and retired U.S. Army major and was elected to Congress in 2018. He is currently chair of the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee. He is an outspoken advocate of U.S.-Mexican border security and military and veterans issues.
Green won reelection last year in the newly drawn 7th Congressional District which includes parts of North Nashville and northwestern Davidson County defeating progressive Nashville organizer Odessa Kelly 60 to 38. The district stretches from the Kentucky to border down to the state line with Alabama. Of the three members of Congress who represent Nashville Green is the only member to locate a field office in the city.
Last month Green launched a brief unsuccessful bid for U.S. House Speaker as Republicans struggled to coalesce around one candidate. He was eliminated in the second round of closed-door votes.
Prior to his election to Congress Green a served two terms in the Tennessee state legislature. Green was nominated for U.S. Secretary of the Army by then-President Donald Trump in 2017 but withdrew after drawing criticism for previous statements about gays lesbians and Muslims.
Election Day is Tuesday Nov. 5 2024.
A Tennessee doctor who relocated to Indiana after at least four of his patients died of drug overdoses was indicted this week on federal over-prescribing charges.
Dr. Darrel Rinehart who treated patients in Columbia until 2017 has been charged with 19 counts of prescribing controlled substances without a legitimate medical purpose according to a news release from the Department of Justice.
Bonnie Blackburn whose son Mathew died of an overdose while under Rineharts treatment in 2015 said she had hoped the doctor would be criminally charged but always doubted this day would come.
Yippee yee-haw hallelujah. I hope they put him under the jail she said.
OPIOID CRACKDOWNWhat Tennessee doctors were charged We've got a list.
Rinehart is one of 60 medical professionals who were charged as part of a nationwide probe designed to combat the opioid crisis in federal court. Thirty-two of those defendants were charged in Tennessee.
The indictment states that four of Rinehart's patients died while in his care but a joint investigation by The Tennessean and The Indianapolis Star published earlier this year revealed an even higher death toll.
According to the joint investigation at least five of Rineharts patients suffered fatal overdoses that were partially or wholly caused by drugs he prescribed between March 2015 and January 2016 records state. Health officials are also suspicious of two more deaths of patients who were taking Rineharts prescriptions but they were not autopsied because Rinehart told investigators the patients were killed by natural causes.
Six more patients had nonfatal overdoses between 2014 and 2016 according to an expert's review of Rinehart's medical records. One of those patients to whom Rinehart prescribed at least 11 different drugs overdosed three times.
DARREL RINEHARTOne doctor five deadly overdoses What we know about the victims
Finally Rinehart was caught on undercover video increasing a patients opioid prescription without any examination and adding an Adderall prescription after the patient casually asked for something to help me focus.
The Tennessee Board of Medical of Examiners suspended Rinehart's medical license but stopped short of revoking it after the doctor promised to never attempt to practice medicine in Tennessee again. State attorneys had argued for full revocation.
This is a pattern of negligence and bad practice that extends to anything he tries to do with his license here or anywhere in this country Samuel Moore a government attorney said while describing Rineharts prescriptions to a state licensing board.
This isnt medicine. This is something else.

TriStar Health hospitals will partner with local law enforcement to host Crush the Crisis opioid take back day.
The community is invited to safely and anonymously dispose of unused or expired prescription medications at participating TriStar Health hospitals.
The opioid crisis has been declared a public health emergency. Every day more than 130 people in the United States die from opioid-related drug overdoses. The misuse of prescription opioids often begins when they are obtained from a friend or family member's medicine cabinet. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse in 2017 there were 1269 overdose deaths involving opioids in Tennesseea rate of 19.3 deaths per 100000 persons which is higher than the national rate of 14.6 deaths per 100000 persons. Kentucky is among the top ten states with the highest opioid-related overdose deaths. In 2017 there were 1160 reported opioid-involved deaths in Kentuckya rate of 27.9 deaths per 100000 persons compared to the average national rate of 14.6 deaths per 100000 persons.
Our goal for 'Crush the Crisis' is to bring awareness to the dangers of opioid addiction and increase awareness about the proper disposal of these medications said Dr. Jeffrey Hodrick orthopedic surgeon. Opioid addiction can happen to anyone and unused opioids are a major source of misuse and diversion. We want to provide this opportunity as a confidential and anonymous way for the community to dispose of their unused medication properly.
Who TriStar Health hospital volunteers including doctors and nurses and uniformed law enforcement officers invite the community to safely dispose of their unused medications.
What Crush the Crisis Opioid Take Back Day
Accepted medications include tablets capsules and patches of Hydrocodone Norco Lortab Vicodin Oxycodone Oxycontin Percocet Tramadol Ultram Codeine Fentanyl Duragesic Morphine Hydromorphone Dilaudid and Oxymorphone Opana. We will not be able to accept needles syringes lancets inhalers or liquids.

Where
In just two years fentanyl poisoning deaths have doubled across the nation and in 30 states including Tennessee deaths have more than doubled according to a new analysis from Families Against Fentanyl.
The Volunteer state is among 20 states with the highest number of fentanyl deaths last year according to the nonprofit's analysis calculated using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from May 2019-2021.
More'No parent should go through this' Fentanyl drives explosion of drug overdoses in South
In six states  Alaska Colorado Louisiana Mississippi California and Texas  fentanyl fatalities increased nearly fivefold according to the study.
Meanwhile the fentanyl nightmare is driving an explosion of drug overdoses in the South.
Overdose deaths reported each year have risen more than 70 during the past five years in Alabama Arkansas Louisiana Mississippi and Tennessee according to CDC data analyzed by The Tennessean.
Those five states combined reported nearly 4100 overdose deaths in 2016. By 2020  the most recent year on record  the same states reported nearly 7000 overdose deaths.
In some states a life-saving drug is just a few clicks away.
The anti-overdose medication naloxone also known by the brand name Narcan is for sale at NaloxoneExchange.com which is run by a fast-growing startup that expanded into Tennessee in 2019.
Naloxone is largely viewed as a front-line defense to the opioid crisis because it can be injected or inhaled to reverse an opioid overdose in the moment.
Loved ones who lost someone to fentanyl poisoning have started nonprofits  not only to get the word out about access to Narcan but to spread word about the epidemic and even offer fentanyl paper test strips which are an easy and inexpensive method to avert a drug overdose. They can detect the presence of fentanyl in pills powder or injectables.
In some cases nonprofits are even offering to help compensate families with funeral costs.
Nonprofit efforts across the South
Wanting to keep her son's legacy alive Tonja Jacobs created the Romello A. Marchman Foundation a nonprofit to help families in Nashville who are grieving after losing a loved one from an accidental fentanyl overdose.
The Antioch-based organization founded in 2021 works to help families of young people between 15 and 25 years old who died of an accidental fentanyl overdose with funeral expenses in Davidson County.
It gives 500 to each family to help pay for services.
Jacobs is pushing lawmakers to put up billboards across Nashville that read One pill can kill.
I feel very strongly that the Tennessee government is responsible for their residents and they need to get this information out there she said.
In Arkansas the Matt Adams Foundation offers financial assistance for treatment and transitional programs while working to break down the stigma of addiction and encourage hope healing and second chances.
The nonprofit also distributes naloxone and fentanyl test strips.
We provide a safe space no questions asked said Heather Starbuck who founded the nonprofit. We focus on harm reduction. We also push to get naloxone out to first responders who dont have it.

The pregame pills took some of the pain out of Will Bell's hard-hitting high school football games  but it wasn't the linebacker's name on the prescription.
Bell was getting opioid-based painkillers  sometimes for free sometimes for a price  from a friend who suffered from a chronic disease.
They made me feel good. I didn't feel pain from tackling. I didn't feel pain from lifting Bell said.
As his friend's pain management regiment graduated from Vicodin to Percocet to hydrocodone to oxycodone so did Bell's. His use of the powerful drugs only escalated in college where aided by even better access to dealers he descended into addiction.
Bell now 26 eventually sought help and has found an incredible recovery community in Nashville the North Carolina native has been clean for 14 months.
For many of the millions of Americans caught in the growing scourge of opioid abuse the outcome is far worse. And few places have been hit harder than Tennessee.
The state said at least 1263 Tennesseans died from opioid overdose in 2014 the most recent figure available and one that points to rampant abuse misuse and addiction impacting millions of Tennesseans according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
For every one person who dies there are 851 people in various stages of misuse abuse and treatment according to the CDC. That's at least 1074813 Tennesseans or 1 in 6.
More people died in 2014 from opioid overdose than in car accidents in Tennessee.
As abuse and overdose reach unprecedented levels across the country prescription painkillers such as hydrocodone and oxycodone are the target of a growing number of federal state and industry initiatives.
Overprescription by providers is a gateway to addiction for many people who may turn to heroin as a cheaper high when caught in the throes of abuse.
The national spotlight on substance abuse and addiction is shining brighter as several federal agencies and institutions look for ways to curb the number of prescriptions as well as the quantity of prescribed pills while increasing access to treatment.
More than half  55 percent  of those who abuse painkillers get them from a friend or relative who has a prescription according to a 2014 report from the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services. Seventeen percent have their own prescription.
The CDC issued guidelines to address and reshape the prescribing habits of providers. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is requiring opioids to have black box warning labels on pill bottles as an additional measure to warn providers and patients of the potential risks.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday proposed to double the allowed number of patients a doctor can treat per month from 100 to 200 in what Dr. Darrell Arnett a Nashville-based pain management and addiction specialist called a huge bulletin of hope.
The moves come as part of a broader effort by the Obama administration to fight opioid abuse which began to spike about 20 years ago when controlling pain  also called the fifth vital sign  became a focus. A pilot study showed that while opioid use has grown patients' self-reported levels of satisfaction with pain control have not improved.
Too many pills dispensed
Tennessee has the second highest rate of prescriptions per person behind only West Virginia. Extra pills can be given away with good intentions  to help someone who has pain  or sold person to person in casual yet illegal trades.
A patient may get dozens for a broken bone or a chronic disease and then another amount at a follow-up a few weeks later. The person might become physically dependent or wind up giving them to acquaintances.
Many take a path similar to that of Bell who got started with pills from someone else's prescription before moving on to heroin.
Officials are trying to reduce the number of pills in medicine cabinets as well as increase awareness about the dangers of prescription narcotics.
People taking a Percocet from a friend or relative are not thinking 'One day I might end up on heroin.' We need to make people aware these are connected said Dr. David Reagan chief medical officer of the Tennessee Department of Health.
The state has been tracking opioid prescriptions for several years through its controlled substance monitoring database. Providers should check to see what a patient is taking before writing any controlled substance prescription.
There are 42835 people cleared as registrants  or those authorized to check patient history  to use the database as of 2015 up from about 14000 in 2010 according to a recent report from the Tennessee Department of Health to the legislature. There were 6.4 million patient reports requested the same year.
The number of providers and others designated to search the database continues to grow albeit at a slower pace than in previous years Reagan said. The number of queries also is growing In 2010 there was one search for every 14 prescriptions. In 2015 there was one search for every three prescriptions.
However one of the problems with the database is providers are not consistently using it Arnett said.
State and industry officials as well as providers say that the state would benefit from a national database or access to bordering state databases given how frequently people cross state lines to get a prescription.
Even with the database the state's overdose death rate has grown. The total for 2015 will not be available until midsummer and Reagan is not sure which way it's going to go.
Rethinking prescription habits
Changes to how some narcotics are prescribed  in 30-day prescriptions with no refills  are changing how doctors dispense medicine.
Dr. John Hale a doctor in Union City and the Tennessee Medical Association's president said taking away refills has been the best thing they've done to address the problem. Patients have to come back to get another round giving providers another opportunity to assess use and need.
It's also changing the size of prescriptions.
Data from BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee correspond with anecdotes that doctors are prescribing more tablets per prescription since the no-refill rule went into effect. Instead of 20 tablets with a refill a provider will prescribe 30 or 50 with no refill said Natalie Tate vice president of pharmacy management for BCBST in Chattanooga.
The number of paid claims for opioids from BCBST's commercial marketplace and Medicare Part D plans totaled 921439 in 2013. It jumped to 1068050 in 2014 which coincides with BCBST selling plans on the federally run exchange and in growth in Medicare plans. Total claims including refills then fell by 53525 or 5 percent in 2015.
The insurer's data on total units dispensed shows a 1.2 percent decrease from 67.4 million to 66.6 million from 2014 to 2015. In 2013 before adding some members there were 58.2 million units dispensed.
Tate said people may not know how to dispose of excess tablets or hoard and save for a rainy day.
People with excess medication can take it to police stations to turn it in without consequence. State health officials are working with some pharmacies to be drop-off points under a recent change in legislation.
Bell understands overprescription and the access he readily found to painkillers. He recalled in high school going back to the dentist three times after having his wisdom teeth removed and faking nausea from the pills to get another prescription.
In college he saw a provider for two years to get suboxone but alternately held onto the drug used to treat addiction as a backup for when he didn't have pills or heroin  or trading it on the street for drugs.
He dropped out when he stopped being a pretty functional addict and his life shattered into pieces. He knew he was physically addicted at 19.
Now clean for 14 months he's about to start the final two courses he needs to graduate with a degree in English and a minor in psychology. He's found solace and opportunity in painting.
It's been amazing to see the turnaround in my life Bell said. Addiction and recovery in the community is something that I've become passionate about.

Resources for help with substance abuse
Rachel Blado rolled out of bed at 432 a.m. and sank into a chair outside her bedroom to read her Bible. Her unassuming home in the Nashville suburbs should have been quiet at this hour but a faint chatter echoed from downstairs. Someone had left a television on overnight.
Blado a mother of three in her late 30s shuffled down the steps into her living room then followed the noise to the basement which a year ago had been converted into a bedroom for her 20-year-old son Josh Holton. Through the door she could hear her son's TV streaming TED Talks which he watched every night before bed.
Blado peeked inside. Holton was sitting awkwardly on his couch slumped forward and to the side like he had fallen asleep while reaching to touch his toes. Blado stepped into the room to rouse her son calling his name and shaking his shoulder. His skin was cold.
Suddenly Holtons head rolled to the side revealing thick mucus draining out of his nose and mouth.
Then I heard this horrible horrible noise  a deep hideous wailing  and I realized it was me Blado said describing the moment she found her son. I ran out of the room tried to make it back up the stairs but collapsed. My husband came down and I just screamed Hes gone. Hes gone. 
Soon the house in the suburbs was busy. Paramedics rushed into the basement bedroom then determined that Holton was long gone killed by some sort of drug overdose in the middle of the night. They summoned a detective from the Metro Nashville Police Department who cordoned off the basement and began to search for clues. On Holtons table he found pills crushed into a line of blue-gray powder and a straw made from a tightly rolled 20 bill.
Meanwhile Blado got on the phone and roused three of Holtons closest friends all of whom had known him since childhood who hurried to the house as the sun rose. Blado met them at the door hugged them tight and pointed toward Holtons room.
Go in and see him Blado said. This is what drugs do.
The three young men stood in a doorway and peered inside. Belongings were splayed across their friend's messy room remnants of a life cut short  a dresser full of books dangling boxing gloves and a cluster of artsy photos pinned unceremoniously to the wall. Holton was still on the couch.
The police detective turned to the young men in the doorway speaking matter-of-factly as if he had been here a thousand times before.
Do you know what he might have taken the detective asked.
They did. Or at least they thought they did.
One of the friends answered.
Xanax.
OPIOIDS1 family 3 deaths Couple must pick up pieces  again  after overdoses
MOREThis pain clinic nurse gave a patient 51 pills a day. And she kept her license.
A fake pill  A deadly lie
No one knows exactly how Josh Holton died but it is clear he wasnt killed by Xanax.
His body was found a little more than two years ago in the early morning hours of Sept. 15 2016 at his parents home in southeast Nashville. Police closed all investigations into the death earlier this year and deemed it an accidental overdose involving no prosecutable crime.
But in a state that has been ravaged by the opioid epidemic recording more than 7000 casualties in five years Holtons death was something different. He was not a surgery patient who became addicted to painkillers after being prescribed too many for too long. Nor was he a heroin addict who died while scouring the streets for the biggest high of his life. And he didnt overdose on meth or cocaine or a deadly combo of opioids and benzodiazepines all of which kill hundreds of people in Tennessee each year.
Instead based on multiple interviews and a review of police documents personal text messages and emails it appears that Holton fell victim to the little-known threat of counterfeit medication which experts say is thriving in the anonymous and unregulated corners of the internet. Holton who was quietly mourning the death of his biological father bought Xanax a sedative often used to treat anxiety on the darknet to help himself cope. Instead Holton received pills containing only fentanyl an opioid 50 times stronger than heroin.
Much of the research into Holton's death was done by Blado herself who spent months probing her son's computer and squeezing answers out of his friends some of whom were too scared to speak with police. For this story she shared much of her research with The Tennessean in an effort to spotlight the danger of counterfeit pills.
I think Josh was self-medicating but not explaining to his friends what was really going on Blado said. He was inexperienced and he found something he didnt know was dangerous. And it killed him.
Counterfeit pills have been found in 45 states and caused deaths in 27  including as many as three others in Middle Tennessee  according to the Partnership for Safe Medicines a California nonprofit that studies the issue.
This death toll is also certainly undercounted because overdoses from fake medications are notoriously hard to confirm at least in part because the victim is often the only person with knowledge of what drug they intended to take.
Regardless the cases that are confirmed span everything from fake painkillers to fake cancer drugs said Shabbir Safdar executive director of the nonprofit. Many victims look exactly like Holton young men who try to buy Xanax online but instead receive fake pills made with black-market pill presses and cheap fentanyl imported from China or Mexico.
For all practical purposes this is happening throughout the entire country right now Safdar said. If youve got an interstate these pills are most certainly in your state.
'He could never have too much knowledge'
Holton was born in southern Maryland but came to Nashville in middle school as his mother and stepfather moved to Tennessee in search of jobs during the 2008 recession. As a teen he attended Lighthouse Christian School in Antioch then graduated through home schooling and enrolled at Middle Tennessee State University. At the time of his death Holton was attending classes at Nashville State Community College and working full time at the Nissan plant in Smyrna. In his free time Holton was an avid photographer who dreamed of one day transforming his hobby into a small business.
Despite this busy life in Nashville Holton remained close with his biological father Doug Brown Jr. a self-made Maryland restaurateur whom he often visited over the summer. Brown and his brother Daniel with whom Holton was also close drowned in the Chesapeake Bay in 2015.
Friends and family say Holton never recovered from the death of his father and uncle and his mourning worsened symptoms of insomnia that had plagued him for years. Sadness and exhaustion put a subtle damper on a young man who was otherwise ponderous inquisitive and relentlessly ambitious.
In addition to photography Holton dreamed of following in the footsteps of his entrepreneurial father and showed interest in real estate graphic design and the stock market. On the day he died he was scheduled to attend a class on advanced Microsoft Excel which he hoped would help get him a promotion at the Nissan plant.
He was always learning and I dont think he was capable of having a surface conversation said Trinity Thompson 22 who was Holton's friend since middle school. He could never have too much knowledge and he would ask why about everything until you were having this deep conversation and you didnt even know how you got there.
This same inquisitiveness is likely why Holton was so enamored by TED Talks an online series of eclectic speeches that have become widely popular in the digital age. Thousands of TED Talks have been posted since the platform went online in the mid-2000s and presenters include scientists philosophers religious leaders and former presidents.
Holton watched these talks nightly when he got home from his late shift at the Nissan plant his mother said. And it was from one of these talks she says that Holton first learned how to buy narcotics online.
In the year before he died Holton watched a 2015 TED Talk by Jamie Bartlett a journalist who had recently published a book on the darknet a portion of the internet that can be accessed only through anonymous browsers.
In the 14-minute speech Bartlett focuses heavily on how illegal drugs can be bought secretly and anonymously online and at times describes the online marketplace as an achievement of innovation capitalism and customer service. The author stresses that he is not promoting drug use but he also says at one point that buying drugs on the darknet is a reasonably good way of guaranteeing a certain level of purity.
Many of you here will be on the darknet fairly soon. Not that Im suggesting anyone in this audience would use it to go and procure high-quality narcotics Bartlett said pausing as the audience laughed.
Blado said one of her son's friends told her this TED Talk is what originally gave Holton the idea to buy drugs online. She watched it for the first time in the months after he died.
Every time the audience laughed she said it just hit me in my gut.
Holtons friend declined to be interviewed by The Tennessean but confirmed that he and Holton bought the pills online after Holton got the idea from the TED Talk. The friend denied any involvement when speaking to law enforcement police records show.
Bartlett did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this article. A TED Talks spokesperson refused an interview but issued a statement saying that Bartletts speech explained how the darknet worked at the time and that neither this talk nor TED condone the purchase of illegal or non-prescribed drugs on the darknet.
'It looked just like any other Xanax'
As far as his family knows Holton bought drugs off the darknet only twice.
The first time was in August 2016 about a month before his death when he and his friend ordered Xanax off AlphaBay an anonymous marketplace that has since been shut down by the federal government. It is believed that the first shipment was really Xanax and Holton took the pills without issue.
But then in September Holton and his friend ordered again.
Holton's family found out what the pills really were about two months later. Officials emailed Blado a copy of her sons autopsy report showing authorities tested his blood for more than 75 drugs but found just fentanyl. The blue-gray powder on his desk also tested positive for fentanyl  and only fentanyl  records show.
Now burdened with the truth Blado knew she had to warn the others. On Thanksgiving as her son's friends gathered in her home to play board games in the basement Blado pulled out a copy of the autopsy report and asked them to read it.
Some ran out the door and fell on the ground. Others just stood there. Others sat on the couch crying Blado said. I realized then that they really really really didnt know about counterfeit medications.
The reveal was especially thunderous for Chris Brown one of Holton's closest friends who was also one of the few people to see the darknet pills before Holton died.
In an interview with the Tennessean Brown said Holton confided in him that he was buying Xanax online and taking the pills before bed. Brown was worried about his friend but kept his concerns to himself.
Later Holton offered Brown one of the pills and Brown reluctantly accepted. It was marked with a trademark Xanax stamp just like medication he had gotten from a pharmacist before. Brown said the pill put him into a deep sleep but left him unharmed.
To this day Brown does not know for certain if he took a real pill or a fake one.
Thats the most haunting thing  it looked just like any other Xanax Brown said. This could have happened to any of us.

The lawsuit alleged the Food City in Bearden sold enough pills to give 130 to every man woman and child in Knoxville. Food City denied the claims.

NASHVILLE Tenn.  Food City and the state of Tennessee announced both reached a settlement following a years-long lawsuit over alleged eye-popping opioid prescription numbers involving a store in Knoxville.
Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti announced a multi-million dollar settlement with Food City over its opioid-related misconduct on Thursday.
According to the attorney general most of the 44.5 million settlement will go to Tennessees Opioid Abatement Fund to support efforts addressing the opioid epidemic.
Every entity that contributed to the opioid crisis must be held accountable Skrmetti said. Our Consumer Protection Division remains relentless in the pursuit of justice and I am proud of their aggressive enforcement in this case. By paying a hefty price to resolve past misconduct Food City provides critical resources to save lives and protect families and can now get back to the business of serving its customers and supporting Tennessee communities.
Food City said the allegations from two cases in Knox and Sevier counties stemmed from circumstances from more than a decade ago saying it agreed to ensure future compliance by providing additional training to pharmacy staff updating the prescription-validation process and monitoring and reporting data related to suspicious activity the release said.
The AG said the settlement also included an agreement for Food City to provide employment opportunities for Tennesseans recovering from opioid addiction.
K-VA-T Food Stores Inc. Food City's parent company made a statement on the settlement below
K-VA-T Food Stores Inc. announced today that it has entered into an agreement to end two opioid-related cases in Knox County and Sevier County Tennessee. The cases are examples of thousands of cases nationwide brought against manufacturers distributors and retailers of prescription opioid products. The allegations in these two actions focus primarily on circumstances from more than a decade ago. K-VA-T has continually disputed any allegations of misconduct made in these actions. The agreement states that it is not an admission or evidence of any liability or wrongdoing. K-VA-T believes the settlement agreement is in the best interest of all parties and will contribute to the opioid-related programs that are being established as a result of the previous settlements with national retailers and distributors. K-VA-T is committed to the communities it serves and has pledged its support of local drug rehabilitation centers and their efforts to assist persons in recovery to lead more productive lives.
In 2021 the Tennessee Attorney General sued Food City over its opioid prescription numbers accusing the company of aiding and abetting unlawful oxycodone sales at three of its Knoxville pharmacies in Bearden West Hills and Hardin Valley in the middle of the opioid overdose epidemic. The allegations focused particularly on the Bearden store off Kingston Pike.
Among the accusations
Over a four-month period the store in Bearden bought more of a type of potent opioid pill than 38 states and the District of Columbia.
The Bearden store sold more of a type of opioid than any other retail pharmacy in the state from 2006-2014.
For a period of time the average prescription at the Bearden store was 267 opioid pills an average of nine pills per day for a 30-day prescription.
Between 2006 and 2014 the store bought 18 million Oxycodone pills which would be enough for every person in Knoxville to have 130 each.
The lawsuit came a couple of years after Tennessee's previous attorney general Herbert Slatery sued drugmaker AmerisourceBergen in 2019 over accusations it had unlawfully distributed more than 8.5 million oxycodone pills between 2006 and 2012 to the Bearden Food City location in Knoxville.
WASHINGTON  Lawmakers should view Americas staggering opioid crisis including the rise of illicit fentanyl through an ecosystems approach argues a massive RAND Corporation report published Thursday.
That means they should examine the gaps and interconnections among emergency response data collection education treatment housing and law enforcement the report advises.
The 600-page volume  which the authors describe as arguably the most comprehensive analysis of opioids in 21st century America  encourages federal state and local lawmakers to think beyond traditional silos and innovate ways to stem adverse effects of addiction and increasing drug overdose deaths among Americans.
There have been lots of initiatives and efforts to try to address it but when we looked around the majority not all but the majority seemed to fall in the silos  like Were going to improve treatment or Were going to focus on harm reduction or Were going to decrease illicit use and try to decrease supply said Bradley Stein Director of RANDs Opioid Policies Tools and Information Center.
RAND headquartered in Santa Monica California is a nonprofit organization that focuses on several areas including the U.S. military education national security and health care.
One of the things we did was sort of step back and say Are there opportunities sort of between these systems between the silos And so thinking about it more as an ecosystem or more holistically are there things and opportunities that we may be overlooking Stein one of the authors who is based in RANDs Pittsburgh offices told States Newsroom.
Overdose rates jump in recent years
Drug overdose rates in the U.S. have risen fivefold in the past two decades according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study published in December.
The study shows that deaths attributed to opioids including synthetic opioids like fentanyl and its many analogs have been steadily on the rise with a staggering jump in recent years.
The CDC tracked a record 107622 overdose deaths in 2021  71238 of them were due to manmade illegal fentanyl substances.
The agency defines drug poisoning overdose deaths as those resulting from the unintentional or intentional overdose of a drug being given the wrong drug taking a drug in error or taking a drug inadvertently.
Illicit fentanyl ending up in other drugs  for example counterfeit prescription pills cocaine and heroin  has been the target of federal agencies and the subject of multiple congressional hearings and roundtables.
GOP lawmakers on the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee are poised to mark up the HALT Fentanyl Act a measure reintroduced this Congress by Republican Reps. Morgan Griffith of Virginia and Bob Latta of Ohio.
The bill aims to permanently classify fentanyl-related analogs as Class I substances under the Controlled Substances Act.
Just this month a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers including Democratic Reps. Joe Neguse of Colorado and Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania launched the Fentanyl Prevention Caucus.
The group plans to tackle education and destigmatizing the opioid overdose-reversing medication Naloxone said Dean who is public about her sons recovery from opioid addiction.
Not enough data
One of the gaps facing lawmakers as they try to legislate a solution is a lack of data. The U.S. is essentially flying blind the RAND report states.
Weve had this opioid crisis for a while but if we look nationally there are still all these areas where we still dont have a good sense of the magnitude of the problem. How many people use fentanyl how many people are using heroin Stein said.
Stigmatization of users unintended consequences of criminal penalties and a lack of communication across systems all hamper clear data collection that could improve peoples quality of life in other areas  for example housing child welfare and employment the report argues.
However some state and local governments are developing ways to bring data together Stein said.
The report notes that Maryland has linked data across health care substance use treatment criminal and legal statistics and mortality information.
Rhode Island has pulled several data sets including valuable information collected from nonfatal overdoses and distribution networks of Naloxone in one data center hub.
Pennsylvanias opioid data dashboard among other data tracks the number of Naloxone doses administered by EMS personnel and emergency room visits for opioid overdoses
Tim Leech vice president of Pittsburgh Firefighters Local 1 responds to varying volumes of drug overdose emergency calls that ebb and flow with the trends of local drug use.
We are usually the first ones to encounter the patient. Once were there and we start treating the patient the paramedics will arrive. And depending on the severity its possible that a doctor could come as well after the patients care is handed over to the paramedics Leech said in an interview. No matter what happens every call I go on when I go back to the fire station I submit information on our computer database and theres a code for overdoses.
Dean talked about efforts in the Philadelphia area to coordinate care across institutions.
We have an area of the city known as Kensington where some of the most difficult cases of mental health poverty and addiction are all coming together she said mentioning that she recently spoke to the Philadelphia-based Sheller Foundation about efforts to address overdoses.
So literally what the Sheller foundation is doing is trying to bring together different hospital systems and nonprofits and recovery centers and housing to get at this problem in a very coordinated way instead of just one recovery at an ER and out goes the person with the problem to another ER.
Advice to lawmakers
The RAND report several years in the making suggests a four-part framework that decision makers can use when thinking about crafting effective policies to help those with substance use disorders.
That four-pronged approach includes
Integrating issues and systems.
Experimenting with new approaches.
Developing roles for people who can take ownership across systems.
Revamping data systems to better understand the problem.
The studys authors built a searchable tool to encourage a holistic approach when policymakers are weighing how to tackle the opioid crisis.
Theres not a silver bullet Stein said.  Individuals with opioid use disorder move across so many pieces of this ecosystem. But often one part of the system doesnt have a very good idea of whats going on in another part of the system.
A man living in the same apartment building as a woman killed in a fatal drug overdose after Christmas is now facing a murder charge in connection with her death.
Johnny Wayne Tucker 73 was indicted by a Davidson County grand jury on a charge of second-degree murder Metro Nashville police said in a statement Wednesday.
MoreNashville metro had second-highest rate of overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2022 report says
Emergency services were called to an apartment at the Curb Victory Hall a building for veterans experiencing homelessness on Christmas morning. Caroline Black 35 was rushed from the scene to a hospital after she was found unconscious police said.
Black died two days later and medical examiners determined she died from fentanyl toxicity.
Tucker according to court records supplied Black with heroin that was laced with fentanyl.
A private security group brought in by businesses downtown Solaren Risk Management are very concerned about the current fentanyl crisis.
They are not only worried about the public but the impact on first responders.
The CEO of Solaren Risk Management Jack Byrd says overdose deaths have increased more than 200 in the last five years in Tennessee and he says most of these cases include fentanyl.
The Metro Nashville Public Health Department says there have been a total of 1383 suspected overdoses since the beginning of 2023.
The health department adds there have been 103 suspected deadly drug overdoses so far this year and their spokesperson adds about 75 of the suspected overdose deaths have a fentanyl presence.
Byrd emphasizes this is a nationwide problem.
This is the single fastest growing epidemic as far as drugs go in the history that we ever tracked Byrd said
Byrd says it is a public safety concern and it is dangerous for first responders because a person that touches it or breathes it could succumb to its effects.
This fear now is unheard of. Just the amount of precautions that have to take place for officer safety Byrd explained.
Byrd adds the drugs are more potent and he explains they are administering more Narcan a medicine used to reverse an overdose more than ever.
Traditionally officers would carry one or two pouches of Narcan with them and we have cases now where people are using six seven eight just to sustain them Byrd said.
Monti Herring with STARS Nashville a local nonprofit that has mental health and substance abuse services says the best way to address this epidemic is more education.
Herring says he wants to see more businesses schools and non-profits taking advantage of their free training on drugs and overdoses.
The trainings that the state gives us covers a lot of different topics. Not just how to recognize or respond to an overdose and how to administer naloxone but it also talks about reducing stigma Herring said.
Herring emphasizes awareness is key and you can sign up for a free training through

NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  Drug overdoses are on the rise across the country and theyre largely driven by fentanyl.
According to the Metro Nashville Public Health Department in the first quarter of this year there were 173 suspected drug overdose deaths that occurred in Davidson County.
The data revealed 79 of those cases detected fentanyl.
Tuesday evening the founder of The Romello Marchman Foundation Tanja Jacobs will give a presentation to council-members to really take a deeper dive into what the fentanyl epidemic is and the importance of spreading awareness.
The CDC reports drugs may contain deadly levels of fentanyl and its nearly impossible to tell if drugs like cocaine are laced with it.
The rise in overdoses motivates her to share the story of her son Romello Marchman who died of fentanyl poisoning in 2020.
She thinks of these deaths as murder and not overdoses.
Kids are stressed. They don't always tell parents everything about how they feel. They go to a friend that has a pill and in this pill could very well be laced with fentanyl Jacobs said. Sadly kids die and then the parents find them dead the next day.
Jacobs will be sharing her story with council members and will be joined by Former Nashville Mayor Megan Barry for the presentation. Her son died of an overdose in 2017.
I can't even stress enough how important it is to meet her personally from a mother to a mother she said. This is the first time I will meet her and I'm looking forward to it. I really hope that she is willing and able to help us connect with people.
Jacobs plans to keep growing the foundation and host more awareness events.

Police are investigating after two men died and another was revived after a suspected drug overdose in in downtown Nashville early Tuesday morning.
All three were found unresponsive on 6th Avenue North just after 430 a.m. Tuesday the Metro Nashville Police Department said. Police identified the two who died as Joshua Wolfe 34 of Elkhorn Nebraska and Karl Smith 25 of Lac la Biche Alberta Canada.
A 26-year-old man who police said was Wolfe's friend and also from Elkhorn was revived after being given Naloxone. Naloxone is a medicine that can help reverse a drug overdose.
Investigators are looking into the possibility that fentanyl was involved and working to identify where the men got the drugs MNPD said. The man who survived told detectives he does not remember what happened.
Downtown surveillance footage is also being reviewed police said.

Tennessee Voices A conversation with Kristen Gilliland on youth and substance abuse
Kristen Gilliland of the Warren Center for Neuroscience Drug Discovery spoke with The Tennessean Opinion and Engagement Director David Plazas.
Over the past two years rural Greene County in northeastern Tennessee has collected more than 2.7 million from regional and national settlements with opioid manufacturers and distributors. But instead of helping people harmed by addiction county officials are finding other ways to spend it.
They have put 2.4 million toward paying off the countys debt and have directed another 1 million arriving over more than a decade into a capital projects fund. In March they appropriated 50000 from that fund to buy a litter crew vehicle  a pickup truck to drive inmates to collect trash along county roads.
Its astounding said Nancy Schneck a retired nurse who has seen addiction infiltrate the community where employers avoid drug testing for fear of losing too many employees and mental health crises and homelessness are rampant. She wants to see the money go toward mental health and addiction treatment. Why cant county leaders see treating some people and maybe getting them out of this cycle might be advantageous she said.
In 2021 the latest year for which comparable data is available Greene Countys rate of drug overdose deaths topped state and national figures.
But Mayor Kevin Morrison said the county has borne the costs of the opioid epidemic for years It has funded a beleaguered sheriffs office improved the jail  which is packed with people whove committed addiction-related crimes  and supported a drug court to divert some people to treatment. It has also suffered indirect costs of the crisis people dropping out of the workforce due to addiction schools and welfare services caring for more children whove experienced trauma and some taxpayers leaving the county altogether. Addiction is not the sole reason for Greene Countys economic woes but it has contributed to more than 30 million of debt.
Weve been dealing with this crisis for quite some time but nobody wants to pay the bill as it comes Morrison said. So when these funds are made available then we are paying bills that have been due for quite some time.
The debate in this Appalachian county is reverberating nationwide as state and local governments receive billions of dollars from companies that made distributed or sold opioid painkillers like Johnson  Johnson Cardinal Health and CVS. The companies were accused of fueling the overdose epidemic and the money is meant to remediate that harm. About 3 billion has already landed in state county and city coffers and about 50 billion more is expected in the coming decade and beyond.
States are required to spend at least 85 of the money on opioid-related programs but KFF Health News ongoing investigation into how the cash is used  and misused  shows there is wide interpretation of that standard and little oversight.
That restriction didnt apply to the money Greene County moved to its capital projects fund.
In many rural communities which have been struggling to pay addiction-related costs for decades local officials justify using the settlement funds to reimburse past expenses. Most of Tennessees 95 counties are in significant debt which can present difficult choices about how to use this money said Robert Pack co-director of East Tennessee State Universitys Addiction Science Center.
Still he and many advocates hope the settlement funds are spent on tackling the current crisis. After all more than 200 people nationwide are dying of overdoses each day. Investing in treatment and prevention can save lives and protect future generations they say.
There is no good excuse to sit on the funds or put them into a general fund said Tricia Christensen policy director for the nonprofit Community Education Group. The organization is tracking settlement spending across Appalachia which Christensen called the epidemics ground zero. These dollars should be used to support people who have been most impacted by the overdose crisis.
Nationally there has been little oversight of the settlement dollars. President Joe Bidens administration pledged to ensure the funds went toward tackling the addiction crisis but has taken little action. Accountability at the state level varies.
In Tennessee 15 of the states opioid settlement funds are controlled by the legislature and another 15 by local governments. Those two buckets have few restrictions.
The other 70 is controlled by an Opioid Abatement Council which has more rigorous standards. When the council which must give 35 of its funds to local governments recently distributed more than 31 million to counties it required the funds be spent on a list of approved interventions such as building recovery housing and increasing addiction treatment for uninsured people.
I can guarantee were going to bird-dog those funds said Stephen Loyd chair of the council and a physician in recovery from opioid addiction. If counties use them for unapproved purposes the counties will not receive future payouts he said.
Greene Countys reimbursement of its capital projects fund comes from its own pot  the 15 that is controlled entirely by local governments.
In such cases the public can hold officials accountable Loyd said. If you dont like the way the money is being spent you have the ability to vote.
Local leaders are generally not being nefarious with these decisions he said. They make hundreds of budgetary choices a month and simply dont have experience with addiction or health policy to guide them in using the money.
Loyd and other local experts are trying to fill that gap. He meets with county officials and recommends they speak with their local anti-drug coalitions or hold listening sessions to hear from community members. Pack from East Tennessee State urges them to increase access to medications that have proven effective in treating opioid addiction.
Both men point counties to an online recovery ecosystem index where leaders can see how their areas resources for recovery compare with those of others.
In Greene County for example the index indicates there are no recovery residences and the number of treatment facilities and mental health providers per 100000 residents is below state and national averages.
Thats a great place to get started Loyd said.
Some Greene County residents want to see opioid settlement funds go to local initiatives that are already operating on the ground. The Greene County Anti-Drug Coalition for instance hosts presentations to educate young people and their parents on the risks of drug use. They meet with convenience store owners to reinforce the importance of not selling alcohol cigarettes or vaping devices to minors. In the future the coalition hopes to offer classes on life skills such as how to budget and make decisions under pressure.
If we can do prevention work with kids we can change the trajectory of their lives as adults said Wendy Peay secretary of the anti-drug coalition and executive director of United Way of Greene County.
The coalition has asked the county for settlement funds but has not received any yet.
Nearby in Carter County a new residential treatment facility is taking shape at the site of a former prison. At least seven counties cities and towns in the region have committed a combined 10 million in opioid settlement funds to support it said Stacy Street a criminal court judge who came up with the idea. Greene County is among the few local governments that did not contribute.
It will be part of the regions drug recovery court system in which people with addiction who have committed crimes are diverted to intensive treatment instead of prison.
Currently there are no long-term residential facilities in the area for such patients Street said. Too often people in his court receive treatment during the day but return home at night to the same sandbox playing with the same sand-mates increasing their risk of relapse.
Street said the new facility will not offer medications to treat opioid addiction  the gold standard of medical care  because of security concerns. But some patients may be taken to receive them off campus.
Morrison the Greene County mayor said he worried about contributing to the facility because it is a recurring cost and the settlement funds will stop flowing in 2038.
Theres been great pressure put on local entities like Greene County to try to solve this problem with this limited amount of funding he said when the federal government which has the ability to print money to solve these problems is not in this business.
The county is still deciding how to spend nearly 334000 of settlement funds it recently received from the states Opioid Abatement Council. Morrison said theyre considering using it for the anti-drug coalitions education efforts and the county drug court. Given the guidelines from the abatement council these funds cant be used to pay old debts.

TobyMac's son is one of hundreds of people to die in 2019 across greater Nashville as a result of an overdose involving fentanyl  an epidemic health experts on Wednesday said they expect to worsen this year.
Truett Foster McKeehan the Christian rap artist's 21-year-old son is one of 424 people who died of drug overdoses in Davidson County with 64 of those deaths involving fentanyl Metro Public Health Department records show.
Provisional data for 2019 shows a 28 increase from 2018 said Trevor Henderson Nashvilles opioid response coordinator. Last year's numbers are provisional he noted and may increase as cases are closed.
Moreover projections for fatal drug overdoses for 2020 show the trend will likely continue to worsen with fentanyl remaining the primary contributor health officials said.
McKeehan was found unresponsive at a home in the city's Radnor neighborhood on Oct. 23. Autopsy and toxicology results show he died with a cocktail of drugs in his system.
Davidson County Medical Examiner Feng Li ruled McKeehan's cause of death to be acute combined drug intoxication stemming from an accidental overdose of fentanyl and amphetamines.
Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that can be fatal in doses no larger than a few grains of sand said Dr. David Edwards chief of the division of pain medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
In powder form Edwards said. It's just a little bit of dust in a small vial but enough micrograms can kill you.
Its cheaper to produce than heroin but approximately 50 times stronger so some drug traffickers mix fentanyl into their drug supply to inflate profits. Fentanyl is also increasingly found combined with cocaine and methamphetamine both of which have caused more deaths in recent years.
McKeehan's toxicology findings show he had 8.7 nanograms per milliliter of blood of fentanyl in his system and 7.9 nanograms per milliliter of blood of metabolized fentanyl in his system.
In deaths related to fentanyl Edwards said blood concentrations can vary widely but in a New York state review of autopsies representing people who died with multiple drugs in their system an average of 8.2 nanograms per milliliters of blood with a range of 1.1 up to 38 led to their deaths.
Drug use in Middle TennesseeA spike in overdose deaths in Nashville may be tied to fentanyl health officials warn
In Li's summary report he wrote McKeehan had a history of drug and alcohol abuse as well as possible nitrous oxide use. Nitrous oxide is commonly known as laughing gas. He was discovered unresponsive in bed by a friend conducting a welfare check on Oct. 23.
A toxicology report also found McKeehan had adderall and marijuana among other drugs in his system at the time of death.
It was not immediately known where McKeehan got the drugs.
Metro police spokeswoman Kris Mumford said the case remained open on Wednesday.
Other Middle TN cases
More than 9100 people died of drug overdoses in Tennessee between 2013 and 2018 according to state death data. More than 70 of those deaths were at least partially caused by opioids including fentanyl.
A 26-year-old Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival attendee died in 2019 after he overdosed on drugs including fentanyl.
Ryan Dunleavy of Brentwood was found the morning of June 15 in the venue's Manchester's campgrounds his autopsy results show. He was transported to Unity Medical Center in Manchester where he was pronounced dead.
According to a toxicology report Dunleavy had drugs including fentanyl MDMA ecstasy and clozapine in his system when he died. Autopsy results show Dunleavy's manner of death was accidental.
In some of the overdose cases across Tennessee authorities have arrested the decedent's dealer. It's part of a strategy to fight the opioid epidemic.
One month before Dunleavy overdosed  after nearly a year and a half of extensive investigative work  Metro Nashville police charged 32-year-old Christopher James Floyd with murder in connection to a woman's 2017 death.
Authorities said Roberts provided the mix of heroin and fentanyl that killed Sara Roberts who fatally overdosed at the East Thompson Lane home where she lived with her mother.
An autopsy found the 33-year-old Nashville woman died of acute drug toxicity from a combination of alcohol and heroin laced with fentanyl.
Floyd remained jailed in Davidson County Wednesday awaiting trial on more than 100000 bond.

180 Health Partners wants to get pregnant addicted women into detox so babies will be healthier.
The company will work with TennCare's MCOs to identify women and connect them to resources.
The number of babies treated for NAS in 2014 is four times higher than in 2008.
It's attracted high profile boardmembers and investors as the state struggles with opioid addiction.
Melanie McCarter is about to start a job doing what she loves helping women find the right resources to get and stay clean so they can have a healthy life.
McCarter a mom of a 15-month-old son will start next month at 180 Health Partners  a new company focused on providing collaborative multidisciplinary care for pregnant women who are addicted to opioids that is attracting high-profile investors and board members.
Shell be a peer advocate someone who understands where the mom-to-be is at in life and help them get connected to the resources and motivation they need.
For McCarter it's a chance to be part of the support structure that people need  a peer who understands what it's like to be pregnant and addicted. She lost a baby at when she was nine months pregnant several years ago while fighting an opioid addiction.
Basically that Ive been where they are at and I came out of the other side clean McCarter said. I had family to push me in the right direction and not everyone has that.
Babies can be born drug dependent with a withdrawal syndrome called neonatal abstinence syndrome or NAS when they are exposed to opioids such as oxycodone or heroin while in the womb.
There were at least 1063 babies treated for NAS in Tennessee in 2014 because thats how many were treated by TennCare that year. Justin Lanning CEO of 180 Health expects the number is closer to 2000 to 2500.
Tennessee is dealing with a rising number of overdose deaths amid a struggle with opioid abuse and misuse that health officials dub an epidemic. Alongside the rising overdose death rate is an increase in the number of babies treated for NAS under TennCare. In 2008 the agency treated 264 newborns.
180 Health based in Brentwood will start working in January with some of the companies that administer TennCare to identify women who are at risk for having babies with NAS and getting them connected with either detox or tapering and other community resources.
180 Healths goal is to reduce the number of babies born dependent and help the women stay clean after giving birth so they and their family can have healthier lives.
Tennessee faces epidemic of drug-dependent babies
The company will work with obstetricians under TennCare to identify addicted women and assist them with getting into detox or tapering programs to get them off opioids before the baby is born. Dr. Mary Jane England a psychiatrist and professor at the Boston University School of Public Health said this could save the baby from undue harm.
Opioid use overtakes tobacco
We have science now that shows that detox and tapering programs are not harmful to the fetus said England a 180 Health board member. Dr. Craig Towers an obstetrician and professor at the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville did a five-year study on the effects of detox and is chairman of 180 Healths clinical advisory board.
The process is difficult but England said pregnancy is a moment to catch women when they are focused on the health of their baby.
If you ask a mom what shell do for her baby shell do a lot for her unborn baby England said.
The company will send people including peer advocates like McCarter social workers and nurse educators into the womens homes or accompany them to doctors visits. Transportation and missing work are often barriers to getting treatment or staying in recovery programs so 180 Health wants to fill in those gaps Lanning said.
It also will help the woman connect into resources in her community to ensure she has a recovery and support system as she adjusts to being a mom under the added pressure of staying clean. 180 Health will stay in touch with the woman for a year after she delivers.
Reducing the number of NAS babies and helping women get successfully into recovery carry financial and social benefits.
There are more opioid prescriptions than people in Tennessee
TennCare spent 48854 per NAS baby in 2014 versus 4951 for non-low birth weight babies. A baby born with NAS spent an average of 24 days in the hospital compared with two days for a healthy baby.
Even with the cost of treating a pregnant woman roughly 10000 to 12000 the early intervention is a less expensive option that has the potential to save treatment down the road Lanning said.
With a five-year 50 percent uptick in the number of people losing their parental rights due to addiction across the state it could help keep families together.
Tennessee parents lose kids as opioid crisis rages on
The company's mission and approach have attracted board members who have worked with Medicaid or managed-care organization entities in the past. Darin Gordon who left as TennCare's director in June for the private sector is chairman of the board.
Addressing opioid addiction and its ripple impacts at a time when women are already engaging with the health care system by bringing in behavioral health and community recovery resources will bring a holistic approach to treating addiction without stigma said Dr. Bill Frist an investor in 180 Health. Frist a former U.S. senator also backs Aspire Health which sends palliative care clinicians to people's homes.
The company plans to be working with 500 to 600 women by the end of the year and deepen its relationships with providers who may have been hesitant in the past to send women into treatment out of concern they would be prosecuted Lanning said. The company will get paid by the MCOs as it makes inroads in reducing the number of babies born with NAS.
We focus on a too often stigmatized frequently disenfranchised population who at a special time in their lives around the birth of their child today at best receive fragmented care that lacks continuity and chances of long-term success for mother and child Frist said. We are the first company in the opioid crisis to take to scale this comprehensive holistic dedicated approach to empowering moms with healthy babies.
McCarter's job officially starts Dec. 1 exactly a week before she celebrates being four years clean.
Opioid abuse has death grip on Tennessee
The cool thing is Im in on the ground level so Im getting to help them come up with different ideas and different ways to help women  whats going to be support or enabling she said. I have a passion for this. There are so many women  I just hope we can reach more people so they can get help. More healthy babies and more healthy women.

NewsChannel 5 explores the ongoing opioid crisis in Tennessee and tell the stories of some of those impacted by the issue.
State continues focus on prescriptions to combat opioid crisis
For many the reality of the opioid crisis has ripped families apart.
In total 1776 people died of a drug overdose in Tennessee in 2017. Deaths related to opioids counted for nearly 1300.
It is a number that continues to rise despite efforts to cut down on the number of opioid prescriptions. Pinpointing the exact cause of the problem can spark debate but many would not deny that overprescribing painkillers was one of the root issues.
Althea Myles is recovering from nearly a decade-long addiction to opiates at the recovery center Turning Point in Southaven Mississippi.
She said it all began when she was prescribed Percocet following a surgery.
I can recall going back to my doctor and telling him I have a problem and he proceeded to give me extra drugs Myles said. I have to accept I played a part at one point. I did know better but if somebody keeps giving you something and you go to him for advice you tell your mind it's ok.
Andrea Kirchner is also recovering through a program at Turning Point. She started abusing Percocet four years ago before she turned to heroin because it was cheaper and stronger.
I was a functioning addict very well. I ran a business and was a successful business but as my addiction got worse my business went under within two years Kirchner explained.
Opioid abuse does not discriminate on race sex and income. It is evident when you sit in at one of the counseling sessions helping patients learn how to communicate properly again.
Kirchner said she is finally recovering on her own terms and hopes to get her family back.
Will I get my family back I have to show them I'm serious this time and I am because I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. There's nobody to rush home to. There's nobody. I'm trying to do this for me finally I'm doing it for me she said.
To help battle the opioid crisis Governor Bill Haslam unveiled the 30 million plan TN Together. It focuses on law enforcement prevention and treatment. Limiting the number of prescriptions is one key component in the plan.
Under the new law healthcare practitioners may give an opioid prescription of up to three days with a 180 MME total dosage to patients in need of a small dosage.
Depending on the condition they can also prescribe opiates of up to 10 or 20 days but would require extra steps including conducting a thorough evaluation of the patient document consideration of alternative treatment plans for pain and why an opioid was used and obtained informed consent.
Dr. Chapman Sledge chief medical officer at Cumberland Heights said the problem became worse in the early 2000's when standards changed. The medical community then considered pain as a fifth vital sign.
You would have never dreamed of using opiates to treat chronic non-malignant pain in the early or mid 80's.The medical profession was sold a bill of goods that there's this epidemic of under treated pain and prescriptions skyrocketed after 2001. Things absolutely snowballed Dr. Sledge said.
Advocates pushed for the use of opioids like OxyContin while pharmaceutical companies claimed the drugs were less harmful and less addictive.
By 2015 the Centers for Disease Control CDC reported there were enough opioids to treat every American around the clock for three weeks. It said more than 11.5 million people reported misuse of prescription pain medicine in 2016.
Earlier this year Tennessee officials filed a lawsuit again Purdue Pharma the manufacturer of OxyContin for fueling the opioid crisis. It claimed the company valued profit over people despite knowledge of the drug's addictive risks over time.
The state's largest insurance provider Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee has since announced it will no longer cover OxyContin by January 1st. The insurance company will encourage doctors to use two more expensive alternatives Xtampza and Morphabond which are more difficult to abuse. Customers will pay the same copay and BlueCross will absorb the additional cost.
There are reports the number of prescriptions nationwide has gone down last year. Health data firm IQVIA's Institute for Human Data Science said actual dispensed opioid prescription decreased 10 percent while patients receiving high doses declined by 16 percent.
However Tennessee still has a high rate of prescribing.
Hospitals like St. Thomas Midtown have focused on limiting opiates by offering different drug combinations. Dr. Allison Bollinger said it is proving to be helpful.
There's been recent data that shows that if you take ibuprofen and combine it with Tylenol it's as effective as Lortab for pain Bollinger said. It's really important to engage our patients and to have conversations with them in the reasons why we're selecting a non-opioid alternative.
In addition the hospital is already able to access a database that would allow doctors to search how many painkillers a patient has been prescribed and by how many different providers in the country. It also keeps doctors accountable too.
To receive help like Myles and Kirchner you can call the Turning Point hotline number at 1-888-614-2251 or visit turningpointtreatment.org.
Fentanyl deaths make opioid crisis rampant
While data so far reveals a decline in opioid prescriptions amid a crackdown the number of deaths continues to spike not just statewide.
Deaths related to fentanyl passed heroin deaths for the first time in 2017 according to the Tennessee Department of Health. It was associated with 500 deaths a 70 percent increase since 2016.
Fentanyl is a drug similar to heroin but is more potent and can be 100 times stronger than morphine.
T.J. Jordan of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said despite countless warnings and advisories drug users are seeking fentanyl or something even stronger.
With the Chinese government tightening its belt on fentanyl distributed to the U.S. Jordan said it became prime opportunity for drug cartels to infiltrate communities.
However pill press machines are being used in home labs to cut fentanyl into a counterfeit pill or other substances like heroin. Drug users could unknowingly buy illicit drugs and not realize how potentially deadly it is.
What happens is you get one pill right out of the gate that has no fetnanyl in it next may have a sprinkle next may have some spattering and next mostly high content of fentanyl Jordan explained.
Jordan said he heard a story at a recent conference regarding heroin laced with arsenic.
It's a poison that will absolutely kill you and people know it will kill you but yet the drug user is looking
for that high so bad they're willing to go to the drastic measure of having heroin with arsenic in it to put in their bodies Jordan said.
However the problem seems to have no end in sight now that people are using drugs in group settings with a designated person.
Narcan the brand name for Naloxone is available to help revive a person who is overdosing. Depending on the strength of the drug or counterfeit substance laced with a typically unknown amount of fentanyl it may take multiple doses of Narcan to prevent deaths.
We're starting to see where drug addicts are using together with their colleagues in an attempt that if they crash there is somebody there to revive them Jordan added.
Narcan can be administered through a nasal spray or intravenously. Law enforcement and emergency departments like the Rutherford County EMS has been equipped with Narcan for years.
The county used Narcan 123 times in 2013 but it spike last year to 415.
As the need for Narcan grows so does the price. The Nashville Fire Department saw the cost nearly triple in the last seven years.
To help respond to scenes even faster Rutherford County EMS has been using what's called power units. They are crews already roaming around waiting to respond to any emergency.
They go out into the neighborhoods and theyre high visibility on the streets so when a call for service comes in they're the first ones that get the call paramedic Brandon Smith said.
Officials said it's making a difference. An average response time in Rutherford County is about eight minutes.
The deputy director of EMS said with the power units its able to go down to 7.5 or 7.2 minutes. It's a slight change but when it comes to emergencies every second matters.
But with recent opioid laws there are also concerns the use of fentanyl abuse or heroin will increase especially from the pain community potentially increasing the amount of deaths.
Chronic pain patients like Chantal Burke who rely and function on opioids say recent regulations may force others to seek drugs on the streets that are easier and cheaper to get.
The Tennessee Pain Society says doctors have opted out of treating patients or prescribing opioids in general because of stricter rules. There is also fear of legal consequences.
As a result existing pain clinics have been swarmed
Some of the practices I understand are actually no longer accepting any more patients because they're just saturated Dr. John Schneider of the Tennessee Pain Society said.
In 2015 there were more than 350 pain management providers in the state. The number has now dwindled to less than half.
Over the summer Comprehensive Pain Specialist abruptly closed its clinics in the state amid Medicare fraud allegations. It left thousands of chronic pain patients fearful and scrambling to find another provider who'd accept their insurance.
Many fear it would push patients to commit suicide if drugs they have relied on to treat their excruciating pain aren't easily accessible.
Tennessee children left behind by opioid crisis
Sitting on her grandmothers couch inside a tiny apartment on Nashvilles West Side Sandrell Newsome is twirling the ends of her braided black hair between two fingers she is 11-years-old and has been left behind by Tennessees growing opioid crisis.
Sandrell was seven-years-old when both her mother and father were arrested for selling opioids. With both of her parents in jail Sandrell along with her five brothers and sisters were forced to move in with their grandmother Sherl Cox. Sandrells youngest sister is four-years-old her oldest brother is 17 all of them are crammed into this two-bedroom brick apartment that is in desperate need of being renovated. It smells of cigarette smoke and dog food.
With her feet tucked beneath her Sandrell glances off in the distance as she talked about her mom and dad Its hard because theyre our parents and most people expect kids to live with their parents.
This sixth grader is one of the lucky ones in this nationwide epidemic that is leaving behind broken families and broken hearts. Sandrells mother Sharon wasnt using drugs when she was pregnant with any of her kids so none of them were born addicted. Theirs though is the reality hundreds of thousands of families across the country are facing right now. By some estimates more than 1 million children are living with their grandparents because their parents are addicted to opioids.
Sandrell is shy but her grandmother gently coaxes her to talk more about whats happened to their family Ive learned that drugs are not the answer to anyones problem.
A bit of a nervous smile appeared on Sandrells face as she continued talking about the life her and brothers and sister have been forced into It creates a mess for everyone.
The mess the opioid epidemic has created is multifaceted and complicated. Not just emotionally but financially as well. At least twice a month Sherl Cox known in this quickly gentrifying neighborhood as Mama Sherl is forced to go to a nearby food bank because she regularly runs out of food to feed all six kids she has taken custody of.
Im barely making it living here. I pay 800 a month and I work at Burger King so Im barely living Sherl says her voice cracking a bit.
On the day we met Sherl and Sandrell their kitchen was filled with only a few loaves of white bread some peanut butter and instant noodles. Sherl makes every dollar she spends on these six kids last as long as possible.
We just have to make it day by day. We do our best. We survive Sherl said.
This struggling family thought the opioid crisis had already taken enough from them. But in August it delivered another devastating blow after the childrens father Mandrell Newsome died of a heroin overdose.
He was 36-years-old.
Its killing them every day every day. Every day someone is dying of an overdose Sherl says raising her voice with passion.
Sandrell though is not quite as animated when she talks about her dad the young girls tone got quieter as she described how her father died He had taken some drugs and there was poison in them. He was in the hospital for a couple of weeks and they just had to let him go.
Like so many others addicted to opioids Sandrells father turned to heroin because he couldnt afford the prescription pain pills he was craving. Doctors believe the final dose of heroin that killed Mandrell Newsome was likely laced with the drug fentanyl. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse more than 115 people die each day from overdosing on heroin. Every three weeks as many people die of an overdose and they did on September 11th.
Its a reality Sandrell struggles to comprehend.
Its very sad and lonely she said.
It hurts just to know what they have to deal with living without a father in their life so its hard her grandmother adds.
None of Mandrell Newsomes children have been to visit her fathers grave. It sits on the edge of a tiny family cemetery in Kingston Springs Tennessee about 20 minutes west of Nashville.
His family still hasnt been able to afford to buy him a headstone. Only some wilting flowers and a white name placard indicate where Mandrell is buried. Another victim of a crisis that seemingly has no end and another family left behind to deal with the aftermath.
Sherl is able to help her grandchildren through the Family  Children's Services. The Davidson County Relative Caregiver Program provides emotional and practical supports for children and the non-parental relatives who care for them.
Recovery navigators help addicts find treatment
Fighting opioid abuse is getting a boost of support from people who have overcome the same dark addiction in the past.
As of this month a program under the TN Together plan will get to pair people who were revived from a drug overdose with so-called recovery navigators in Nashville.
Recovery navigators are people who have been in recovery for at least two years and completed the Certified Peer Recovery Specialist Program.
Their goal is to connect with patients at the hospital and get them much needed help and support.
Once they're able to give consent the doctor will ask them if they would like to speak to someone and want help. Then they will call one of us and we respond. We give them resources share a little bit of our story of how we've been there and what we've been through and just that there is hope and this is not the end Coon explained.
Coon recovered from her opioid addiction four years ago at Buffalo Valley. She admitted herself to the treatment center after she overdosed on heroin laced with fentanyl.
I remember praying for God to please let me wake up and I wouldn't do this again she said. I knew at that point I did not want to live like that anymore.
Since then she went from being a client to an employee. She jumped on the opportunity to become a recovery navigator because she knows the importance of making a connection.
Doctors counselors and psychiatrists tried to get me sober for a long time until I got my counselor and she had been through the same thing I've been through. That makes a difference so I know it makes a difference Coon said.
Currently there are 11 recovery navigators across the state. Four of them are in the Mid-State.
Under TN Together 25 million focuses on providing treatment to drug users. Part of it includes the expansion of peer recovery specialists in targeted high-need emergency departments.
The program first started in upper East Tennessee and made its way to Memphis and then Nashville. Chattanooga and Knoxville are next on the list.
St. Thomas and TriStar Skyline Medical Center are two hospitals who are a part of the program. The state hopes to include more hospitals in the future.
After she beat back opioid addiction she devoted her short life to helping others do the same.
Tennessee addiction recovery advocate Bethany Bessy Morse 34 died Feb. 2 at her home in Nashville. Friends said Ms. Morse died unexpectedly after experiencing several spells of hypoglycemia or very low blood sugar which research suggests may be more common in people who have battled drug addiction.
Ms. Morse found recovery four years ago at Nashville's Renewal House a program for young mothers and their children. After getting clean Ms. Morse pursued a bachelor's degree in social work which she was one semester away from obtaining from Tennessee State University.
But she did not wait for a degree to do the work of helping others. Ms. Morse devoted her sobriety to trying to pull others out of the grips of addiction becoming a statewide NarCan trainer and distributor with the nonprofit Tennessee Overdose Prevention meeting with Tennessee and Mississippi legislators to offer firsthand accounts of the opioid crisis ministering to Nashville's homeless population and administering the 3500-plus-member Memphis' War on Heroin Facebook page offering support and helping obtain treatment for families.

She was an angel here on earth wrote Tina Garcia one of many friends who posted on a Facebook page devoted to Ms. Morse's memory. The instant she became part of our life everything changed. She loved those with an addiction when they couldn't love themselves. She gave them hope opportunity for a better life second third fifth 15th chances ... whatever it took. To us parents she held our hands gave us strength hope anything and everything we needed. When the days were hopeless she gave comfort. I truly do not know how she did it but she was ALWAYS there. For ALL of us. She saved countless lives.
Ms. Morse was one of the first to offer her image for a Tennessee Overdose Prevention billboard campaign proclaiming WeDoRecover. When asked whether she was embarrassed about her years as an addict and the impact on her family she said I could be embarrassed or I can use my story to help others. She shared her experience on banners and websites and at public events.
After the birth of her son Tyler now 5 who is autistic and nonverbal she became a fierce advocate for his needs as well as for the autism community as a whole.

In addition to the Facebook group Ms. Morse's friends created an Apple Music playlist of her favorite songs under her name. Her funeral  held Friday afternoon in her hometown of Tupelo Mississippi  was livestreamed on the internet and friends hoped to make a recording available for later viewing.
She had friends from all over who can't be there Daniels said.
Area experts gathered in Portland for a panel discussion on the local opioid crisis Thursday.
Members of the community were told about the problems frontline workers face and solutions and resources available to the public.
More Sumner Cheatham coalitions focus on opioid crisis at town hall
More Sumner County participates in Drug Take Back Day prevention awareness
The panel was comprised of 10 people many of whom were involved in local government and local law enforcement from Robertson and Sumner Counties.
Portland Mayor Mike Callis moderated the evenings discussion.
There are very few families that have not been touched by this if its not overdose death its a child that youve seen absolutely just be torn from you because their entire personality has been stolen by the love of the drug State Representative and event panelist William Lamberth said.
In 2019 in the state of Tennessee we had 2089 confirmed overdose deaths 2089 people just gone from us because of this he said. In 2020 that number was up to 3091  thats 1000 more deaths in one year.
Now when you have that kind of increase in one year thats why were all here. Weve all got to focus on this. No one person has all the answers to it but surely collectively we can get that number headed back down the other direction and hopefully get it back down to zero.
A growing crisis
Sumner County Sheriffs Office Major and panelist Tim Bailey illustrated the county's growing crisis by showing the increase in case files the Sheriff's Office handles - a few pages encompassed all of 2015's overdose reports.
A folder contains 2021's overdose reports from January-June.
In 2015 Sumner County had 9 total overdoses one involving fentanyl. In 2019 we had 27 overdoses 21 involving fentanyl. In 2020 we had 35 overdoses 33 with fentanyl and in 2021 so far year-to-date we've had 17 overdoses 16 involving fentanyl he said.
Since 2018 Sumner County Sheriff's Office officers have deployed Narcan a remedy for opioid overdose in the field more than 100 times Bailey added.
We have successfully prosecuted less than a dozen cases where we can find the dealer and charge him with second degree murder he said. We're trying hard to identify these dealers that are dealing this poison but it's not easy.
Other panel officials agreed.
We're doing everything we can as you can see to attack the problem from a lot of different areas District Attorney General Ray Whitley said.
Problems persist
The state's rate of opioid prescriptions available funding manpower and other issues frontline workers face all contribute to the opioid crisis.
The Tennessee Department of Health Drug Overdose Dashboard provides several state-wide statistics on overdose deaths further illustrating the extent of the problem.
In 2018 Tennessee providers wrote 81.8 opioid prescriptions for every 100 people ranking as the third-highest prescribing rate in the country and more than the average U.S. rate of 51.4 prescriptions according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
In 2019 there were 47 drug overdose deaths in Sumner County and 506 nonfatal overdose outpatient visits.
Many in law enforcement say Fentanyl is the biggest contributing factor to the opioid crisis.
Between 2013 and 2017 alone deaths from fentanyl in Tennessee increased by 800 according to the tndagc.org public education campaign - Fentanyl The Deadliest High.
Fentanyl is about everything we see now and touch 18th Judicial District Drug Task Force Director Kelly Murphy said.
They say one kilo of fentanyl has the possibility to kill up to 100000 people just in Sumner County alone. Just in our agency off two cases last year we took in a quarter kilo total of fentanyl so you're looking at the possibility of 125000 people's lives being affected if that hits the streets he said.
I don't think we've ever worked anything as powerful as this that affects as many people.
Thinking about solutions
Interagency cooperation makes up one aspect in the fight against the opioid crisis.
Of all the crimes that we investigate with the exception of child sex abuse I would say that overdoses and overdose deaths probably result in more interagency cooperation than any other crime that we work Portland Chief of Police Jason Williams said.
But cooperation from the public is important too.
It's probably just as important if not more important than cooperation amongst ourselves because these people who are dying out here in the community nine times out of ten we show up and they're strangers to us Williams said.
Without the help of family members friends and neighbors officers don't get very far he noted.
If we have an overdose where someone doesn't die a lot of times we can't get any cooperation from that person because they're just not ready to turn the corner yet and that's frustrating he said.
That's another area where family could possibly help because family support and having a support system in place is the most important thing for somebody to be able to turn the corner and lay down that drug.
But officials don't always know where to look making reporting an important piece of the puzzle.
Policy change takes time
Lobbying for legislation and voting elected officials into office that support the cause can spur major local impact.
And the state government is examining the issue.
House Bill 1132 or the opioid abatement bill was adopted and passed on May 4.
The bill sponsored by Senator Ferrell Haile enacts the Tennessee Opioid Abatement Act fund authorizing the attorney general and reporter to settle claims against opioid manufacturers.
Haile was on hand Thursday to serve on the panel and talk about the bill which outlines how funds received from settlement agreements will be allocated.

Naloxone also known as Narcan is an anti-overdose drug.
While COVID-19 claimed hundreds of lives in Nashville last year drug overdoses killed even more people. Fatalities related to drugs spiked by nearly one-third compared to 2019 which was already a record year.
The numbers published this week are preliminary but the Metro Public Health Department says there were 619 fatal drug overdoses in Nashville last year. Thats up from 468 in 2019.
By comparison Davidson County still hasnt reached 619 reported COVID deaths. When the pandemic is under control public health officials will have to redouble their efforts on drug overdoses says Trevor Henderson the Nashvilles director of overdose response and prevention.
There is a vaccination for COVID. Hopefully we will come out the other side of that sooner rather than later he says. But when we come out from that. This is still here. This is very complicated. There is no vaccine.
There remains a stigma around the disease of addiction Henderson says even years into the opioid epidemic.
The largest age group dying from overdoses are in the prime of their lives between 25 and 44. Most of the deaths from 2020 roughly 80 were related to high-powered fentanyl which is a synthetic opioid that has become a popular street drug that often becomes deadly when its mixed with another drug. The user doesnt know how much theyve taken.
Henderson says theres a clear correlation between COVID and fatal overdoses with the first spike in the month of March and remaining elevated through July. Its unclear however whether the uptick was related to isolation financial stress or even people using powerful drugs alone rather than with someone else who could call for help.
The health department has mapped overdose deaths and 911 calls for help. The hot spots are in Madison and Antioch. But the biggest increase jumping 167 from 2019 to 2020 was the 37209 zip code which includes parts of Sylvan Park The Nations and the area surrounding Tennessee State University.
Overdose fatalities for the entire state are not yet available for 2020 and likely wont be until late summer. But theyre expected to set another record as is the national figure.
Nashville Mayor Mourns Son's Overdose Death Urges Families To Talk About Addiction
Enlarge this image toggle caption Tony GonzalezNashville Public Radio Tony GonzalezNashville Public Radio
The epidemic of drug overdose deaths has hit home for the mayor of Nashville Tenn. Her 22-year-old son Max Barry died last month of an overdose near Denver.
And for the first time since tragedy struck her family Mayor Megan Barry spoke publicly Monday to call on families to have frank and difficult conversations about addiction.
I don't want his death to define his life but we have to have a frank conversation about how he died. The reality is that Max overdosed on drugs Barry said. My hope is that it may inspire and encourage other parents out there ... and that if that saves one life what a blessing.
The mayor who resumed her work duties after nine days away described a new normal.
I get to get up every day now and I don't ever get to talk to my son again she said. Max is not going to text me back. I'm not going to hear his voice again.
The mayor's mourning has been as public as can be. Civic leaders and hundreds of everyday citizens turned out to two open memorials where Barry received hugs for hours.
While she didn't speak at the funeral her husband Bruce Barry a Vanderbilt University business professor did.
We all  of all ages  have made incredible mistakes in our lives and we almost always walk away from them. And he made one that you don't walk away from he said. But the point I want to make here is the circumstances ... tell the story of his death and not the story of his life.
Friends and relatives paint Max Barry's life as one of humor and a love of the outdoors which led him to the University of Puget Sound. He graduated in May.
Yet from the moment that his death became public there was no hiding from the fact that an overdose claimed his life. The mayor said paramedics administered Narcan to her son  the anti-overdose medicine  but it didn't save his life.
Jefferson County Colo. where the Barrys' son died saw a 100 percent increase in overdose deaths from 2002 to 2014 according to the Colorado Health Institute. In Nashville first responders have been carrying the antidote as overdose deaths rise. There were 261 overdoses in the city last year prompting the mayor to budget for a new opioid specialist earlier this year. And Mayor Barry said she'll find ways to do even more including using her platform.
If you see another child who is struggling don't ever hesitate to pick up the phone and call that parent she said because parents you know sometimes we don't see everything that's in front of us.
She said her son  her only child  can never be replaced.
But I know that with my faith and with my family and with my friends we will get through this she said. The reality is that I'm back to work. And we have a lot of work to do in Nashville.
NASHVILLE Tenn.  Mayor Megan Barry heard a knock at her door at 3 a.m. on Sunday July 30.
Your first thought is that you've had a police officer who's been injured she said and you need to get dressed you need to go to the hospital and you need to comfort the family.
Instead she was the one who would need comforting. The officers at the door told her it was her son who had just died of a suspected overdose in Denver hours earlier.
Barry told NBC News Wednesday her son had a combination of drugs in his system when he died of an overdose 10 days ago.
She said the drugs included Xanax cocaine and the opioids methadone and hydromorphone. The autopsy report showed the cause of death as combined drug intoxication.
I didn't see it coming Barry said  even though Max Barry 22 had been to rehab once before in Florida for abusing Xanax. Hed recently graduated from the University of Puget Sound and moved to Colorado.
He was our only child she said. I want to just shake him and say 'What were you thinking'
Max Barry son of Nashville Mayor Megan Barry and Bruce Barry died from an apparent overdose in Denver Colorado on the evening of Saturday July 29 2017. Barry Family
At an emotional memorial service last week the mayor's husband Bruce remembered his son.
We've all made incredible mistakes that we could almost always walk away from he said. He made one he couldn't walk away from.
Barry returned to work for the first time on Monday and she has decided to take her story public.
It's definitely part of my new normal she said. To bring awareness to this because I don't want this to happen to anybody else.
In Nashville alone last year there were 245 deadly overdoses involving opioids the mayors office said. Thats a 120 percent jump from the year before.
On Tuesday President Trump stopped short of declaring a national emergency  but pledged to ramp up law enforcement to combat the crisis.
We're not going to arrest our way out of this problem Barry said. You need having access to beds and treatment. Treating this like a disease by declaring a federal emergency  we would get those resources that we need.
Max Barry's last text to his mother. NBC News
Barry said her sons death still hadnt sunk in.
This hole that I have in my heart will never be filled she said. And I reach for my phone because like most 22-year-olds we texted a lot.
She shared their final texts just hours before her sons death.
I'm so grateful that the last words we said were I love you and I love you too Mom.
Overdose deaths attributed to meth and cocaine have risen dramatically four years in a row
Narcotics investigators say Tennessee is flooded with cheap potent meth smuggled from Mexican super labs
The sun wasnt up yet when the cops surrounded the storage unit in Clarksville.
Two weeks of sleuthing had built to this moment. Narcotics investigators had intercepted a street-level meth sale in Kentucky then backtracked the dealers supply through a few stash houses and across the state line. And now poised outside this storage unit they hoped to find a mother lode hidden inside.
They werent disappointed. When the raid was over and the sun had risen investigators had found more than 54 pounds of bright white crystal meth. It had been cooked in a Mexican drug lab more than a thousand miles away then smuggled to Tennessee where it would be worth more than 2 million on the street.
This was a very very large amount of methamphetamine said David Thompson director of the Pennyrile Narcotics Task Force which led the drug investigation. And there is no doubt that these are cartel drugs.
This meth seizure which occurred June 20 was one of the biggest Tennessee drug busts in years and a victory for law enforcement in a seemingly endless war on dangerous narcotics. But the bust also illustrates how methamphetamine trafficking in Tennessee has evolved making drugs cheaper more dangerous and more difficult to stop according to narcotics investigators throughout the state.
FENTANYLFor years heroin has been the deadliest drug in Nashville. Not anymore.
Cartel meth killed hundreds in 2017
A decade ago most of Tennessees meth was cooked in small batches made in countless ramshackle labs hidden in the states rural stretches. But today investigators said the state is flooded with stronger cheaper meth smuggled from industrial-style cartel labs in Mexico. That same smuggling infrastructure also carries cocaine another cartel drug that largely piggybacks on the meth trade.
And as this smuggling operation has grown the results have been deadly. Deaths attributed to overdoses on meth cocaine and other stimulants have risen dramatically over the past four years according to recent statistics from the Tennessee Department of Health. Cocaine deaths mostly concentrated in Nashville Memphis and Knoxville have increased by at least 20 percent annually reaching 306 last year. Deaths involving meth and other stimulants which are spread widely throughout the state increased by at least 50 percent annually peaking at 319.
Knoxville appears to have been hit the hardest. According to the state statistics cocaine deaths in Knox County more than doubled from 26 in 2016 to 55 in 2017. Meth deaths also grew  from 22 to 46.
Sgt. Joshua Shaffer supervisor of the Knoxville police drug task force said the city had long struggled with cocaine but now Knoxville is swamped with so much cheap potent meth that even longtime cocaine addicts have begun to swap drugs.
As far as drugs on our streets there has been a significant increase in crystal methamphetamine Shaffer said. The super labs in Mexico are pumping it out by the tons really.
Meth cocaine and the opioid crisis
In addition to the rising potency and availability of cartel drugs the deaths caused by meth and cocaine are deeply intertwined with Tennessees ongoing opioid crisis which killed at least 1268 people in the state in 2017. Overdose statistics make it exceedingly difficult to determine how these deaths overlap but the narcotics investigators interviewed for this story said they believe many deaths are the result of addicts mixing opioids and stimulants commonly known as speedballing.
Stimulants are an essential part of this deadly cocktail but theyve largely fallen out of the spotlight as public awareness has shifted toward combating the opioid crisis said Tommy Farmer special agent in charge of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations drug division. When the public attention shifted political will and police priorities were quick to follow.
We got worn out with meth stories Farmer said when asked about public interest in drug enforcement beyond the opioid crisis. But we have to remind ourselves that methamphetamine is a tremendously strong addictive drug and that the states appetite for this drug hasnt ever gone away.
MORETennessees prescription pill addiction is getting better but fentanyl looms large
Meth labs are gone meth never left
Meth has long been a widespread problem in Tennessee but years ago state law enforcement found themselves fighting the war on drugs on their home turf. Between 2002 and 2012 more than 16000 meth labs were discovered in Tennessee with many hidden in the states rural counties using the wilderness to cover the foul smoke and stench produced by mixing chemicals. Small-time cooks also were known to mix meth in 2-liter soda bottles  often called the Shake and Bake method  which required virtually no lab equipment and could even be done in a moving car.
But in 2013 state lawmakers enacted strict laws limiting the purchase of cold and allergy medicines containing pseudoephedrine sometimes called meth precursors which are often used as base ingredients in meth labs. Some Tennessee cities went even further requiring prescriptions for all medicines containing pseudoephedrine.
Almost immediately Tennessees meth trade began to change. Drug dealers who had long been able to buy pseudoephedrine with ease could no longer get the bulk ingredients needed to cook meth. Within two years the number of meth labs discovered in the state had dropped from hundreds per month to only a few dozen according to the Tennessee Dangerous Drugs Task Force.
There were a lot of people who say Oh weve done it. We won the war on meth  Farmer said. But we were very cautious because we knew we couldnt do it overnight.
Soon it was become apparent that Tennessee hadnt won any war at all.
Although meth cooks could no longer get enough precursor drugs to run labs Tennessee still had a strong demand for what had long been its drug of choice. Meanwhile Mexican cartels that had traditionally trafficked marijuana were now shifting their focus onto meth. Soon cartel labs were producing meth that was far more potent than anything that had been cooked in Tennessee.
Overdose deaths have been on the rise ever since.
It kind of was a perfect storm said Sgt. Gene Donegan a narcotics investigator with Metro Nashville Police. We passed the regulatory laws on Sudafed  and at the same time the cartels had gotten better with their manufacturing.
Nowadays meth flows from cartel labs beyond the reach of American law enforcement and Tennessee police find themselves shifting focus from small labs hidden in the wilderness to secret smugglers on crisscrossing highways. Sometimes they intercept huge shipments like that mother lode discovered in Clarksville in June.
I know there are a couple of busts that have gotten 20 or 30 or 40 pounds Donegan said. Back when people were doing the Shake and Bake method if you caught them with an ounce that was a lot of meth.
But now like I said weve got pounds and pounds and pounds of it.

Guidance recently issued by the American Society of Addiction Medicine states that patients should have access to the full range of FDA-approved medications. Regulatory agencies including state licensing boards the ASAM said should not discriminate against the type of treatment an individual receives based on unjustified assumptions that certain treatments cause impairment.
Scott began driving for Uber to make extra money for rehab and even tried decreasing his medication dosage. In the meantime he said he faced increasingly uncomfortable questions from his employer who wanted him to stay on but wondered why he hadnt gotten his license yet. He felt torn on what to do.
Ive had 100 success with my recovery he said. What made it so hard is the science was on my side on this. What happens if I am right and then you put me into long-term treatment Who knows what happens after that
He didnt know that federal authorities at the time were actively investigating a similar scenario just two states over in Indiana.
A very strong signal
Though the protections afforded to people with substance use disorder by the Americans with Disabilities Act are more than three decades old experts say the stigma and discrimination faced by people who use buprenorphine and methadone remains endemic.
Over the years Friedman and her colleagues at the Legal Action Center have represented many clients who have been forced to make the choice between their legally prescribed medication and their livelihoods or access to services.
Weve personally witnessed people struggling with these orders to taper off she said. Suffering and kind of agonizing about whether they should go back to an appropriate dose where they were thriving or continue to taper against medical advice so that they can comply with some ill-thought-out and discriminatory order.
Until recently there had been little enforcement of ADA protections for people who take medication to treat their opioid use disorder. The Justice Department first published its argument that discrimination based on a patients use of medication was tantamount to discrimination based on disability in 2018 when it reached a settlement with a skilled nursing facility that denied admission to a patient who used Suboxone.
Since then the agency has released guidance explaining how the ADA applies to opioid use disorder and expanded its work to various contexts filing lawsuits and forcing entities into consent decrees.
The push to protect access to these medications is part of the Justice Departments overall strategy to combat the opioid epidemic. Its cases have focused on people penalized for using the medications or who have been denied access to them  including in the criminal legal system where few correctional facilities allow prisoners to use them.
Our rigorous enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act should send a clear message that the rights of people with disabilities including those with opioid use disorder must and will be protected said the DOJs Clarke. When it comes to opioid use disorder we reject discriminatory and unlawful policies and practices that are rooted in nothing more than stereotypes myths and misconceptions.
Other federal agencies including the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have also stepped up enforcement. But experts say its the DOJ that has sent the strongest signal and established critical precedent where there once was little.
Just last year it reached its first settlement resolving claims of employment discrimination based on MOUD when it required a Tennessee county to make policy changes and pay damages to a correctional officer who was pushed out of his job because he used buprenorphine. The agency found that the Cumberland County Sheriffs Office had violated the ADA by failing to make reasonable accommodations to allow him to work and use the medication.
Each time the Justice Department breaks new ground Friedman said it becomes easier for front-line attorneys to advocate for their clients in court. It also helps patients like Scott.
Like any good lawyer faced with a problem Scott began to research. He learned his medication was federally protected and then about a case remarkably similar to his own.
In March 2022 the Justice Department announced its findings that Indianas State Board of Nursing had violated the ADA by requiring that a nurse who was seeking to reinstate her license stop using buprenorphine in order to participate in a program that rehabilitates and monitors nurses with drug or alcohol addiction. The boards abstinence-only policy violated the law according to the Justice Department in part by creating barriers that screened out people who used MOUD.
Indianas nursing board denied breaking the law but agreed to pay damages and make policy revisions to ensure that nurses who use medication can remain on it while participating in a monitoring program.
Scott suddenly felt like he had something to stand on. He began to push back against TLAP.
Not fit to practice
By the fall of 2022 Scotts life had changed. Hed left his job at the law firm because he couldnt get licensed but got a new job negotiating contracts at a health care company. His first child a boy was born.
Scott had previously asked the Board of Law Examiners for more time as he tried to figure out how to comply with TLAP. He had decided he wanted to stay on buprenorphine so he asked TLAP for permission to get a second opinion this time from a Tennessee-based program hoping a new evaluation would support his use of the medication. Though TLAP granted his request by then Scott had grown increasingly frustrated with the process and traded a handful of contentious emails back and forth with the organization.
The board allowed him to postpone his final hearing to get the evaluation but warned that failure to comply with TLAP would be grounds to deny him his license.
Scott paid 6000 for the three-day evaluation submitting again to drug tests cognitive testing and extensive questioning about his criminal record and family history.
The results came a day before the hearing. When he read them his heart sank.
The physician concluded Scott had used buprenorphine for more than a decade without any legal educational or occupational deficiencies or consequences and that his criminal history was representative of living in poverty in a small community not of any underlying personality disorder.
Ultimately however he determined that Scott didnt have a foundation of recovery treatment and was not fit to practice law. The physician diagnosed Scott with mild cannabis use disorder in early remission as well as alcohol use disorder by history. Scott would later dispute both in writing to TLAP  he said he didnt drink alcohol and was able to stop his occasional use of CBD and delta-8 the THC product without issue.
Scott should follow Palmettos recommendation of attending abstinence-based treatment the physician wrote and also consider switching his medication to naltrexone.
Scott and his attorney had arguments on his criminal history prepared for his next hearing but not the new evaluation. When they arrived at his hearing they saw a representative from TLAP which had also received a copy of the report. The stakes couldnt have been higher. If the board denied his application because he hadnt complied with TLAP his bar score would expire before he could apply again.
He had one last option withdraw and reapply as a first-time applicant restarting the clock. He took it.
As he walked out of the room that day he fought back tears.
I have a lot of work to do
A year passed. By the fall of 2023 Scott was spending his days working from home beneath his unused law degree vacillating between hope and frustration. By most standards he was thriving. Hed been promoted and his nearly 2-year-old son was enchanted with his new puppy.
But he hadnt given up on his dream.
Scott reapplied for bar admission. At the end of November he was called to a hearing that would determine finally whether or not hed get to be a lawyer.
Scott received notice of the hearing on a Friday just six days before it was scheduled. He contacted a new attorney Greg Brown who had years of experience representing professionals including lawyers and doctors before licensing boards. Brown spent that night reading through Scotts file and on Saturday morning outraged over what was happening to him officially took him on as a client.
Brown worked through the weekend quickly drafting a legal strategy. He filed a response to the board stating that Scott would not comply with the requirement that he stop using his medication and attend abstinence-only treatment.
Four days later Scott and Brown walked into a hearing room near the Capitol building in Nashville and sat at a white folding table facing four attorneys with the Board of Law Examiners. They expected to go head to head with TLAP and lose and were prepared Brown said to file a federal civil rights claim afterward.
But no one from TLAP was at the hearing. Right away according to the hearing transcript the board made clear it didnt want to discuss Scotts medication or his noncompliance with TLAP at all. Though Scott had filed dozens of pages of supplemental material since the board first referred him to TLAP in 2021  including court records reference letters and detailed explanations of his legal record  the board wanted to focus its questioning on his past conduct. That included his criminal history but also his communications with TLAP and the board which had grown increasingly heated as time passed.
Scotts past and his behavior during the licensure process were troubling an attorney representing the board said at the hearing. His conduct demonstrates that there is a lack of accountability for his actions and long history of conduct that gives rise to certain criminal arrests and then an inability again to control his temper he said.
Scott testified on his own behalf explaining his past criminal charges and apologizing for lashing out at TLAP.
The board highlighted one particular email that Scott sent to Buddy Stockwell TLAPs executive director after he withdrew his application the year before. In it he stated he was looking forward to working with the Justice Department to fix the character and fitness process in Tennessee. It may be funny to you guys but Ive worked my ass off and I have a family to provide for. This isnt over yet Scott wrote.
The board said it didnt want to get into anything regarding the DOJ according to the transcript. But it asked Scott to explain himself.
I was very emotional Scott testified. It hurt. I worked very hard to get here and he had made requirements that I could not overcome.
Brown began pressing the issue. The assessment Scott received before his last hearing he pointed out to the board concluded that Mr. Scott was not fit to practice law because hes on Suboxone treatment. Thats what it says.
He asked if he could bring Scotts doctor in to speak. I dont think that that is our focus a board member said. That  the  any fitness issues or the particular treatment that hes chosen to treat his addictions.
Brown called Scotts doctor anyway. For the first time he testified before the board saying he had no concerns about Scotts fitness to practice law and that he had also treated other professional patients including doctors and lawyers with buprenorphine.
Other witnesses followed offering glowing assessments of Scotts character. After several hours of testimony the board broke to deliberate. Scott steeled himself for bad news.
When they returned the board announced Scott would get his license without any conditions. Scott wouldnt have to talk to TLAP again. It was over.
I bet my eyes were big Scott recalled. I was thinking This is unbelievable.
Before the hearing ended a board member told Scott that the licensure process would have gone a lot easier if he had communicated better. Conflict she advised was an inevitable part of practicing law.
Scott nodded and thanked her. I dont plan to be back before any board ever again he said.
A month later and nearly three years after he passed the bar exam Scott stood in a courtroom in front of a judge and the Tennessee state flag with his right hand raised.
As his son watched him swear his oath of admission to the bar he thought about the price he paid to get there. But he also thought of his grandmother Nellie and how proud she would have been to see it.
Now I have a lot of work to do he said. Its just the beginning.

There have recently been a few minor stories about the closing of Comprehensive Pain Specialists clinics across the region due to financial issues and a federal criminal investigation. Some have even mentioned that an estimated 45000 pain patients are now without a pain management doctor.
If this were 45000 cancer patients not receiving treatment in the weeks to come it would be headline news. People would be up in arms over that denial of care.
If you or somebody you love have not been directly impacted by long-term chronic pain then you are very fortunate. Keep in mind that we are all just one car accident away from that condition.
A car accident in the early 1980s is the reason my husband Jay developed chronic pain. The backlash against opiate addiction and the ill-conceived U.S. Centers for Disease Control response to that is what caused him to end his life.
MoreThe race against pain As clinics close patients need new doctors before pills run out
Jay was young and strong enough not immediately to need pain medications to manage his back injury. He dealt with his pain until his condition degenerated and he was forced to have three back surgeries in 2007 and 2008. It was at this point that he was started on low dosages of pain medications. As time went on he developed some tolerance to these medications.
He worked with a doctor to make sure that he was on the lowest possible dosage that would allow him to maintain some quality of life. He also allowed them to do any other procedure they thought necessary beyond just prescribing medications. This included implanting a device in his side that delivered a constant dosage of medication.
The back injury did not allow him to work and it severely limited him in many ways. A good day was as simple as being able to take our dogs for a walk or to go to the grocery store with me. A bad day would leave my strong fiercely-independent husband in so much pain he would sit in his chair and sob.
Turn to illegal drugs suffer or suicide
We were introduced to the CDC guidelines after Tennessee adopted their version of these in early 2017.
These were guidelines only not laws Tennessee passed an opioid law in 2018 that outlined that patients on long term ongoing care with opioid medications must be seen by a pain care provider. The CDC guidelines go further by recommending a lower dosage a pain care specialist can prescribe.
My introduction to these guidelines came when Comprehensive Pain Specialists told my husband they were cutting his medications by 75 percent. The reason that we were given was that eventually the guidelines might become law. The last thing the doctor said to my husband was My patients quality of life is not worth risking my practice or my license over.
It did not matter to them that my husband was not abusing his medication or that he had been their patient for over five years. It did not matter how drastically they were reducing his quality of life.
Rather than face the unbearable pain that losing his medication would cause him my husband chose to end his life and I supported that decision.
What concerns me most about the closing of these pain clinics can be summed up in what my husband told me after they reduced his medications. He told me he felt like he had been given three choices. He could turn to illegal drugs he could suffer unimaginable pain or he could end his life.
These are the choices now faced by the 45000 impacted by these closures. Imagine if just 1 percent of these people choose the same option he did. That would mean 450 deaths 450 families without a loved one 450 funerals.
Is that what we really want for people with chronic pain Is that what you want for yourself or somebody that you love What other options are there for these 45000 patients
Looking at it now seeing these clinics closing you can see that the patients just do not mean anything to the doctors or some of our legislators.
My question for you the reader and our legislators now is quite simple. What are we going to do to prevent any more suicides
What are we going to do to take care of these patients
How are we going to provide them treatment before any more lives are lost

Dr. Darrel Rinehart had 5 patients die of drug overdoses under his care in 11 months.
Prosecutors indicted Rinehart in March after a Tennessean investigation.
Rinehart intends to plead guilty to at least one drug crime next month.
A longtime Tennessee doctor who had five patients die of fatal overdoses in less than a year intends to plead guilty to a federal drug crime.
Dr. Darrel Rinehart 64 who ran a clinic in Columbia for decades was indicted on 19 counts of distribution of a control substance in March. His attorneys last week filed a motion asking for a court hearing in December at which intends to plead guilty.
One of Rineharts attorneys James Simmons said Monday that Rinehart would confess to at least one count of drug distribution. Simmons said the decision to plead guilty came after Rineharts legal team examined the discovery provided by prosecutors but declined to speak in detail about the case.
Obviously he wouldnt be entering a plea if we didnt feel that was an appropriate resolution to the case Simmons said.
The U.S. Attorney's Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The federal indictment against Rinehart states that he routinely prescribed opioids and other drugs without legitimate medical purpose and that four patients died while in his care.
In January Rinehart was also the subject of a joint investigation by The Tennessean and The Indianapolis Star. State health records showed at least five of Rineharts patients suffered fatal overdoses that were partially or wholly caused by drugs he prescribed between March 2015 and January 2016. At least six more Rinehart patients had nonfatal overdoses between 2014 and 2016 and one of those patients overdosed three times state health records showed.
When asked to defend his prescriptions to state health officials Rinehart said he was ignorant of safe prescribing law and too trusting of his patients.
You always want to do what you could to help people Rinehart told a state medical board. And yes sometimes people tell you things you believe them you trust them you know them but you know theyre not always honest.  That certainly has altered the way I practice medicine now.
Rinehart worked for at least two decades at Core Physicians also known as Family Health Group a clinic in Columbia Tennessee. The clinic was purchased by Maury Regional Hospital in 2015 and the new owners were among the first to take issue with Rinehart's prescriptions.
After his prescriptions were questioned Rinehart relocated to Indiana and worked at least two hospitals. The Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners agreed to suspend but not revoke Rineharts medical license if he agreed not to attempt to practice medicine in Tennessee ever again.
Rinehart was also criminally investigated by police and prosecutors in Maury County who used an informant to capture undercover video footage inside his clinic. But the local case never reached prosecution.
Maury County District Attorney Brent Cooper said earlier this year that his office intended to charge Rinehart with five counts of criminal homicide but instead gave the case to prosecutors at the U.S. Attorney's Office who became interested in Rinehart after reading about him in The Tennessean.
Cooper said he believed federal prosecutors could pursue a stronger case with harsher punishment.
People in this area hold doctors in very high esteem Cooper said. I think convincing 12 citizens beyond a reasonable doubt that what Dr. Rinehart did amounts to reckless homicide would have some difficulties. But I dont think it would be impossible and we were certainly going to try if the federal authorities had not reached out to us first.

He continues We thank them and ONEbox for helping us bring this life-saving program inside our live music venues so that every music fan can safely enjoy their favorite artists across Music City Nashville.
He woke up hazy face plastered against a long aluminum bench looking up at two campus policemen staring back at him.

Whered everybody go Loyd slurred.
The officers laughed  until Loyd vomited nearly hitting their shoes.
The policemen loaded him into the back of a golf cart drove him to 1844 Fraternity Park Drive and asked loudly to the other students partying outside Does this belong to you
Everyone laughed even Loyd who 10 minutes later was drunkenly posing for pictures with the policemen.
Loyd knew he was different from most of the other students When he started drinking Loyd couldnt stop until he ran out or passed out. He stopped drinking in medical school.
Today Loyd is a physician and Tennessees assistant commissioner overseeing the substance abuse services department. That makes him the states chief fighter in the war against opioids abuse.
 InvestigationHow many lives are lost to opioids No one knows.

But the ironic twist  Loyd battled a 100-pain-pills-a-day habit after medical school.
Half of the nights I went to bed I was afraid to close my eyes because I was afraid I would die in my sleep he said. The other half I prayed I would die in my sleep so it would be over.
College got him out of a chaotic home
Loyd grew up on a small farm in East Tennessee in a family of mechanics but he couldnt work a screwdriver or wrench. His family was riddled with mental illness alcoholics and drug addicts.
Home was chaotic so Loyd decided to be the first one in his family to graduate from college where  despite drinking binges  he got good grades.
He went on to medical school at East Tennessee State University.
Becoming a doctor was his ticket out.

The students introduced themselves One was a test pilot for a Stealth Bomber another got a masters degree from University of California Berkeley.
Im sitting there going Oh my goodness. I decided I couldnt let them see me drink.
'Everything melted off me'
In that elite group Loyd got elected class president a role he had all four years.
Pressure started to build at the end of his residency. Married with two young children Loyd felt anxiety about his first job.
Driving home after work Loyd stopped at a red light and flipped open his glove box. There they were some old hydrocodone pain pills his dentist had given him weeks earlier for a procedure.
He broke one in half and popped it in his mouth. Within minutes he had a solution to his problems.
It really felt like everything melted off me Loyd said closing his eyes. I can feel it right now.
Days later when he visited his aunt he rifled through her medicine cabinet. He took some of her Loritab pain pills prescribed for a cough.
Im thinking I could take 10 or 11 and shell never miss them. There were probably 60 in there.
Taking pain pills from his patients
Loyd took a pill a day. Each time he visited her he'd take more pills.
Then he started taking them from patients who brought in prescriptions during appointments.
Oh I see youre on the 7.5 milligram pain pills. You probably need to be on 10 milligrams. Ill write you a new prescription and you can leave that giant bottle of 7.5s with me he would say.
Loyd also asked his doctor friends to write him prescriptions.
I was buzzing I was euphoric he said.
Before long Loyd was ingesting about 100 pain pills a day sometimes swallowing them by the handful often grinding them up and snorting them.
One day he dropped off his son Heath with his father so granddad and the boy could go hiking together.
Loyd in his red Ford F150 reached into his cup holder and grabbed 15 Percocet pills and threw them into his mouth.
'Steve you've got a drug problem'
He looked up and his dad was a foot away staring brows creased at Loyd through the trucks window.
Steve did you just take a handful of pills his dad asked.
No.
The next evening his fathers pickup was in his driveway when Loyd got home.
Get in the truck his father insisted.
The two drove to Loyds sisters house and on the way his father asked
Do you have a drug problem
No Dad Im tired. Look how much I work.
Five minutes passed and father put his hand on his sons knee.
Steve youve got a drug problem.
Dad I do. And I cant stop.
Loyd began sobbing.
'I'm Steve Loyd and I'm hurting'
Im gonna lose my wife my family my house and cars.
Steve his father said slowly none of that stuffs gonna do you any good if youre dead.
Within days Loyd went to Vanderbilt hospital to detox and to a 30-day rehab for professionals after that.
At one of his first 12-step meetings Loyd opened his mouth.
Im Steve Loyd and Im hurting.
That was enough to have men and women in recovery surround him and help him.
He has been without alcohol or pain pills for 13 years.
And Loyd brings all that experience to his job.
I know what its like to want to stop and cant. I know what its like to want to die. I know the shame and guilt he said.
However Im driven every day by my own experience to know that people can and do recover when given the proper treatment and aftercare. We will save lives and we will win in the end.
I cant be convinced otherwise.

NASHVILLE Tenn. AP - A new report on drug overdose deaths as of 2015 in Tennessee says that the fatalities are primarily white mostly male and increasingly less likely to have prescriptions for the drugs.
The Tennessean reports httptnne.ws2qlTEwa  that a Tennessee Department of Health report obtained Wednesday indicates a surge of overdose deaths between 2012 and 2015 in the state with most stemming from overdoses on opioids including heroin and fentanyl. As an opioid crisis sweeps the country Tennessee has had 22 drug overdose deaths for every 100000 residents and 14 nonfatal overdoses for every death.
The report says that more than 86 percent of overdose fatalities in 2015 were white and more than 55 percent were male. Deaths have climbed even as prescription distribution tightens indicating illicit obtainment.
___
Information from The Tennessean httpwww.tennessean.com
Dr. Darrel Rinehart had at least 5 patients die from overdoses in less than a year.
Rinehart has been indicted federally for overprescribing opioids.
State prosecutors were also preparing to charge him with reckless homicide.
Tennessee law enforcement were pursuing reckless homicide charges against an overprescribing doctor who had 5 patients die of overdoses in one year but recently passed the investigation to federal prosecutors as part of a massive opioid crackdown.
Dr. Darrel Rinehart 63 who practiced for decades in Columbia but moved to Indiana after his prescriptions were questioned was arrested two weeks ago on federal drug charges. He was one of 31 doctors indicted across six states in a sweeping effort to combat the opioid crisis in criminal court.
However if Rinehart had not been indicted in federal court he would likely have still been arrested.
Maury County District Attorney Brent Cooper confirmed this week that his office was nearly ready to present a grand jury with five charges of reckless homicide against Rinehart but Cooper gave their case to federal prosecutors because federal drug crimes would be easier to prove and carried harsher punishments. A reckless homicide prosecution in state court would not be an easy case to win Cooper said.
People in this area hold doctors in very high esteem Cooper said. I think convincing 12 citizens beyond a reasonable doubt that what Dr. Rinehart did amounts to reckless homicide would have some difficulties. But I dont think it would be impossible and we were certainly going to try if the federal authorities had not reached out to us first.
Rinehart who practiced in Columbia for two decades was the subject of a joint investigation by The Tennessean and The Indianapolis Star that published earlier this year. The investigation revealed at least five of Rineharts patients suffered fatal overdoses that were partially or wholly caused by drugs he prescribed between March 2015 and January 2016 and health officials were also suspicious of two more deaths of patients who were taking Rineharts prescriptions. Six more Rinehart patients had nonfatal overdoses between 2014 and 2016 including one patient who overdosed three times.
In several cases Rinehart gave his patients whopping prescriptions  despite red flags of abuse  only a few days before they died.
Cooper said that federal prosecutors contacted him after The TennesseanIndianapolis Star story published interested in taking command of his ongoing Rinehart investigation. The investigation was all but completed Cooper said but it was clear the case would be stronger in federal court.
After discussing it with them we realized the federal charges they could potentially charge Dr. Rinehart with carried a much longer sentence than reckless homicide on the state level Cooper said. We also had issues with one or two of our cases where we were close to running out the statue of limitation on some of the earliest overdose deaths.
Ultimately federal prosecutors indicted Rinehart on 19 counts of prescribing controlled substances without a legitimate medical purpose. Court records say those prescriptions went to four patients all of whom died while under Rineharts care.
Rinehart is not facing federal homicide charges. Cooper said his office is no longer planning to prosecute Rinehart in state court.
Rinehart pleaded not guilty to all charges during his first court appearance on April 22. He declined to comment when questioned by a reporter.

An 11-month-old baby girl is expected to make a full recovery after overdosing on fentanyl. Metro Police have arrested the infant's father who faces child endangerment and drug charges.
Police say 27-year-old Aras Babiry reported his daughter took a piece of paper from a bathroom trash can and put it in her mouth. She had white residue on her lips and was having difficulty breathing according to Metro Police. The child later tested positive for fentanyl and cocaine.
At a local children's hospital Babiry denied responsibility for the fentanyl. Police say he later admitted to purchasing the narcotics on Thursday and discarded the remainder in the trash can. When police searched his home officers found a straw on the living room table and a lottery ticket containing a white powdery substance.
Babiry is charged with aggravated child endangerment as well as drug and paraphernalia possession. The Tennessee Department of Children's Services DCS has been contacted. Police said the girl's mother was not present at the time of the incident.

A Tennessee man has been charged with the death of his 23-month-old son who died in October from a fentanyl-related fatal overdose the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department MNPD has announced.
Kelvin Blaylock Jr. 22 was issued with criminal homicide and aggravated child neglect warrants on Thursday by youth services detectives who had been investigating the death of his son for the last three months the MNPD said in a statement.
Blaylock called 911 on Oct. 3 to report that he had woken up inside an Ireland Street residence and found his son Kashton Blaylock unresponsive. The childs mother had dropped their son off to be in his fathers care while she went to work.

Officers responded to the scene and Kashton Blaylock was rushed to Centennial Medical Center where he was pronounced deceased
An autopsy determined that the cause of his death was due to the toxic effects of fentanyl and metonitazene a relatively new high-potency synthetic opioid also known by the street name pyro which is increasing in prevalence in the U.S. It is unclear how the child managed to consume the drugs.
During an interview Wednesday Blaylock admitted to using heroin two hours before finding his son unresponsive the MNPD said.

I am a single mom to two loving handsome young boys and one was taken from me that had so much life left to live and it hurts she wrote.
More than 79000 Americans 55 and older died from an opioid overdose between 1999 and 2019 according to a recently released Senate report.
The rate of overdose deaths increased from 3 per 100000 in 2002 to 12 per 100000 in 2021 the report reads.
Officer Justin Franklin had just left the police station in Hermitage when his radio crackled to life. He rushed to the Old Hickory area where a woman was dying on her front porch.
The scene was so cliche it felt as if it had been ripped from a television screen. The woman was slumped on the porch steps eyelids drooped and barely breathing. On the ground by her side was a syringe a spoon and a dime bag. Relatives were weeping.
An ambulance has been called but nobody knew if it would arrive in time.
Franklin had been here before. Not on this porch or at this house but stuck in this moment. During five years with the Metro Nashville Police Department he had on a few occasions arrived at the scene of a drug overdose before ambulances or the fire department then realized there was little he could do to help. Each time he felt powerless. A badge and a gun meant nothing to an overdose.
But this time was different.
Franklin reached into a pocket on the front of his ballistic vest searching for an answer. Only 90 minutes beforehand his sergeant had issued him a package of nasal spray as part of a new program to stop overdoses. The spray is called Narcan and in a war on overdoses it is supposed to be a silver bullet.
Franklin ripped open the package and squirted the nasal spray into the womans left nostril. She didnt stir. Minutes ticked by and Franklins hope faded with each passing second. He wondered if maybe this woman was too far gone. Or maybe this miracle drug didnt work as well as advertised. Either way by the time the ambulance arrived Franklin felt defeated. He watched as medics loaded the womans limp lifeless body onto a stretcher.
And then she came back. The woman sat up abruptly wide-eyed then tried to jump off the stretcher as medics hoisted it into the ambulance. Yanked back from the brink of death she was confused agitated and even a little combative  but she was alive.
It felt good that what I did actually saved her life. Years before this she would have just laid there Franklin told The Tennessean. Before Narcan she likely would have died. There have been many times before like I said where we felt helpless.
This overdose rescue  occurring on Sept. 1 2017  was the first for the MNPD. The agency issued anti-overdose nasal spray to hundreds of patrol officers last summer and Metro cops have since used the nasal spray to reverse 14 potentially fatal overdoses according to police records reviewed by The Tennessean. The department has recorded only one incident in which an overdose victim was treated with Narcan but still died.
Rescues like these place the MNPD among a growing list of U.S. law enforcement agencies that have assumed a new role on the front lines of the opioid epidemic assisting with overdose treatments that have historically fallen to firefighters and medics.
This largely remains true in Nashville where the fire department administers Narcan about 50 times more often than cops but Metro police officers are now trained and equipped to become impromptu medics in the rare cases where they are the first on the scene of an opioid overdose.
OPIOIDSFor years heroin has been the deadliest drug in Nashville. Not anymore.
OVERDOSESSurgeon general Ask about Narcan  you might save a life
Narcan the brand name of naloxone is an inhalable or injectable drug that stops overdoses by temporarily binding the portions of the brain that normally receive opioids. Naloxone has virtually no effect on someone who has not taken opioids so the drug is not harmful if it is mistakenly given to someone who is not actually overdosing.
More than a thousand police departments across 40 states now carry Narcan according to the North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition which monitors the drug nationwide. A few sheriffs and police chiefs have publicly opposed their officers carrying the drug but the majority of law enforcement appear to have embraced Narcan as the newest tool on a modern cops heavy-duty belt.
Nashville is no different. In response to several years of rising overdose deaths Metro police spent 60000 last summer to buy 790 Narcan kits containing two doses of nasal spray each. Officer Franklin used his Narcan kit to save a life on the very first day they had been issued to patrol officers in his precinct. Since then Metro officers have use the drug to revive addicts at homes restaurants parking lots and street corners.
But rescues like these remain rare and 10 months after the Narcan kits were rolled out to police the vast majority have not been used. For this story The Tennessean interviewed three of the few officers who have used their Narcan all of whom said any reservations they had about the drug vanished as soon as they saw it in action.
Two of the cops described the drug as working like magic.
If you didnt know anything about Narcan you would think this was something fake said Lt. Doug Vinson who oversees Narcan kits in the East Nashville precinct. And it is made so easy and so foolproof its almost hard to mess up.
Vinson knows firsthand what the drug can do.
Last October Vinson was doing paperwork in his office in the East Nashville police station when he heard a shouting from the front of the station.
A pickup truck had come screeching into the parking lot parking sideways across two handicap parking spaces. A frantic man ran into the precinct shouting that his girlfriend had overdosed.
Vinson had a single package of Narcan on his desk waiting to be issued to a patrol officer the following day. The lieutenant grabbed it torn open the package and rushed into the parking lot.
Outside the truck door hung open and the young woman was sprawled across the cab. Her skin was as gray as a corpse. Vinson could see a drop of blood oozing out of a fresh prick in her arm.
Vinson pressed the Narcan to her nose and squeezed just like he had told so many younger officers to do when this situation eventually arrived. The woman snorted but did not wake. So Vinson waited a minute counting the seconds as the boyfriend paced then sprayed a second dose in her other nostril.
Immediately she sat up. It was like she had just been woken from a bad dream Vinson said. It was a relief that it worked and that it was obvious she was alive and going to make it.
And I think secondary to that I thought Wow this works exactly the way they told us in training.
MORE1 family 3 deaths Couple must pick up pieces  again  after opioids' destruction
Rookie Officer Jessica Johann was riding shotgun with her partner on Jan. 26 when they first spotted the white pickup truck weaving between traffic and speeding down the shoulder of Interstate 40.
They flipped on their lights and siren then Johann prepared herself for a chase. If the motorist was willing to drive like this she thought then he was probably willing to run.
The way he was driving the way he was weaving it seemed like intoxication or aggression Johann said. I knew it was something bad and I didnt think he was going to pull over for us.
A moment later the driver had surprised her. He had swerved to the side of the highway and slammed the brakes as if he was anxious to get pulled over. A man then jumped out of the truck shouting that his friend was having an overdose. They were driving to rehab the man said and his friend wanted one last high before he gave it up for good.
Johann rushed to the car to look inside. In the passenger seat a young man sat stiff with his eyelids drooped his chin tilted up and his mouth gaping open. His eyes were gray and his lips were turning blue. Every breath he took was a desperate gasp.
Johann signaled back to her patrol car telling her partner to call an ambulance. A moment later her partner was at her side with a Narcan kit. Johann thought back to her training tore open the package and sprayed a dose in one nostril.
Im sure it was only a minute but it felt like the longest minute ever Johann said describing the incident in detail for the first time. It didnt seem like the Narcan was helping  It was at that instant I thought maybe he would die before the paramedics could even get there.
Johann gave the man another dose.
A minute passed.
Then another.
His mouth closed and his eyes fluttered open. He lifted his head.
Hey Johann shouted caught by surprise. Dont ever do that again
The man looked at her confused as color seeped back into his face.
OK.

NASHVILLE Tenn.The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services is excited to expand a proven program for reversing drug overdoses and connecting patients to addiction treatment to more parts of the state. The U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Assistance is providing a 6000000 3-year grant to expand the program.
First Responder Resource Engagement Specialty Team FR-REST takes Tennessees extensive and successful history of naloxone training and distribution and targets first responders and law enforcement as the audience. FR-REST adds additional resources through care coordination and peer support provided by a person in recovery from substance use disorder.
The model was trialed in Tennessee starting in early 2020 with a grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration covering 14 counties in southern middle Tennessee. In its first year the program trained more than 2300 first responders and received nearly 600 referrals. About half of those referrals resulted in an admission to inpatient treatment and all referrals received recovery support and peer support services.

NASHVILLE Tenn.  Multiple deadly drug overdoses have occurred in Nashville in the last 24 hours.
The Metro Public Health Department issued an overdose spike alert Saturday afternoon after they said three deadly overdoses overnight involved a white powder in the Hermitage area.
On Saturday night the Nashville Fire Department responded to two overdoses one in Donelson and Old Hickory areas that resulted in the patients being sent to the hospital.
Residents are being urged to check in on loved ones and call 911 in case of a possible overdose. Drug users are also being advised not to use alone.

It looks like just a few grains of salt too small to taste but hiding in these tiny white crystals is an unpredictable power to kill.
This is fentanyl the new deadliest drug in Nashville.
Fentanyl killed more people than heroin in Davidson County for the first time ever last year signaling that the core of the local opioid crisis has shifted to a new tier of powerful and dangerous drugs. As Tennessee has tightened its grip on prescription medication many addicts have abandoned doctor shopping in favor of black market heroin and counterfeit pills that are often laced with fentanyl a synthetic cheap-to-produce incredibly potent opioid that was once barely known outside of hospitals. For most people two milligrams is a lethal dose.
The streets are being flooded with fentanyl and its contaminating these other drugs  whether they are heroin or cocaine or counterfeit oxycodone said Dr. Howard Taylor a toxicologist who has witnessed fentanyl spread through Nashville one blood test at a time. Its out there its cheaper and its much more deadly.
MOREFentanyl is killing addicts throughout Tennessee. What is it
MORETennesse police find fentanyl found in cocaine for the first time
In 2017 105 people in Nashville suffered fatal overdoses with fentanyl in their bloodstream  four more than the overdose total for heroin  according to data released Wednesday by city police and the Metro Public Health Department. Although the margin between the death tolls is small officials are most concerned about the swift rise of the fentanyl which has spread through the city faster than heroin ever did. Fentanyl-related overdoses were nearly unheard of in Nashille only a few years ago but deaths rose 250 percent in 2015 then 54 percent in 2016 and 75 percent in 2017.
Although alarming experts described this rise as a predictable evolution of the opioid crisis which shifts from pills to heroin to fentanyl mostly as a result of simple economics. In a series of interviews with law enforcement government officials and medical professionals sources told The Tennessean that the fentanyl deaths show the opioid crisis had deepened to a new stage where drugs are cheaper to make addiction is harder to stop and the risk of fatal overdose is far greater.
And death it turns out is no deterrent. Asked to explain the severity of the crisis police and public health officials told the same story in separate interviews When word gets out that a bad batch of fentanyl has killed a few people many addicts dont try to avoid it.
They go looking for it.
From what we understand the addicts want that said Rachel Franklin a Metro Health official who coordinates responses to mass overdoses. They want the biggest high they can find. They want to go the brink and possibly get brought back with Narcan and not tip over that edge. Its a crazy concept.
Two years ago we thought we were going to come in and say You dont want this fentanyl stuff. It is deadly even as small as a grain of sand. Franklin added. But that is when they say  Where is it
Tennessee's evolving crisis
Tennessees opioid crisis was primarily recognized in 2012 when it became widely known that pill abuse was rampant and that the state had one of the highest rates of pain medicine prescriptions in the nation. Many addictions began with legitimate ailments but then patients began visiting multiple clinics to get redundant prescriptions called doctor shopping to feed a growing dependence to opioids.
MoreOpioid overdoses are rising faster among Latinos. Here's why.
Often these addicts would later transition to heroin which provides a similar high to prescription pills but can be bought in bigger doses for lower prices on the street. And as Tennessee lawmakers tightened restrictions on pain meds  for example creating a database that checks patients for duplicate prescriptions  addicts found it was easier to acquire heroin than pills.
The next shift was almost inevitable. Where the heroin market grows fentanyl is destined to follow.
Fentanyl is cheaper to make than heroin and as much as 50 times more potent so some drug traffickers maximize their profits by selling weak heroin bolstered with fentanyl  a mixture that will kill if the fentanyl is not diluted enough. Dealers have also begun using fentanyl that has been strengthened at the chemical level called fentanyl analogues which can be thousands of times more potent than heroin said Tommy Farmer special agent in charge of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations drug division.
Fentanyl and fentanyl analogues hide in heroin like minuscule landmines waiting to be stumbled upon by an unsuspecting addict. TBI also found fentanyl in cocaine for the first time last year making the party drug  already notorious for overdoses  riskier than ever.
MoreRevolving door of despair Drugs land more women behind bars
It's basically a matter of Russian Roulette I dont care what your tolerance is Farmer said. Youve got dealers with something as small as a gram that can potentially replace a kilo of heroin. There is no way they can get the doses right.
In Nashville Metro Police are now encountering fentanyl-laced heroin so frequently that street cops have been told not test heroin in the field so they don't accidentally inhale a dangerous dose on a windy day.
Sgt. Gene Donegan of the Metro Police's Major Case Task Force said the department is also on the lookout for carfentanil a fentanyl analogue known to be 100 times stronger than regular fentanyl and 5000 times stronger then heroin.
As absurd as it may sound there is a demand he said.
To any any layperson they would think Holy cow I need to stay away from that Donelson said. But to the addict the first thing they think its thats a more intense high then Ive ever had.
And unfortunately it ends up killing them.
MORESuspected drug dealer caught with 40 grams of fentanyl
Fake oxycodone real danger
Despite Tennessee's tighter restrictions on prescription pain pills not all addicts make the jump to heroin. But that still doesnt mean they are safe from fentanyl.
Farmer said the drug is frequently found in counterfeit oxycodone that is made with pill presses in rudimentary black market drug labs. TBI busted 12 counterfeit operations last year but fake pills continue to circulate the state including throughout Nashville.
In a way these pills can be more dangerous than heroin because buyers believe they are taking a professional product with familiar standardized dosage.
In reality the pills could be made of anything.
Inside we find everything from heroin to fentanyl aspirin to nothing and chemicals that we dont know what they are Farmer said. But generally we dont find the one thing they are looking for  oxycodone.
Statewide fentanyl deaths surpassed in heroin in 2016 showing that the progression of Nashvilles crisis is not unique in Tennessee. However statewide overdose data from 2017 has not been released yet so it is unclear if fentanyl is spreading through the state as fast as it is spreading in Nashville.

It's almost like a movie set The room is a warehouse with a judicial bench and courtroom walls erected at one side. Commanding a wood podium in front of a state seal is Nashville Criminal Court Judge Seth Norman and he's talking about coining out.
The term that means nothing to you means everything to those in the room real people working to stop their addictions. Norman reads a name Matthew Lipps. As if it's a cue. In an instant the silence in the room transforms chairs push back  their metal legs scraping the cement floor  the men bellow and everyone claps.
Lipps 34 has made it.
He was hooked on alcohol and pills. Now he gets to live somewhere else outside of the treatment facility guarded by rigid rules not fences that he's called home and hell for 14 months. He has coined out.
It's been a long road he said. I've learned a lot of things. ... I've been doing drugs since I was 8 years old. I look at the world a different way today than I did.
Norman began his treatment court in 1995. It was the first in the state. Now there are 68 recovery court programs in Tennessee that provide addiction services to adults.
That number has exploded since 2013 when there were 33 courts. In 2012 Gov. Bill Haslam shifted funding and oversight of the recovery courts to the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services and directed the department to make those programs available to people in all 95 counties. That remains a work in progress.
More than 1600 people participated in the court programs statewide in the last full fiscal year according to Marie Crosson executive director of the Tennessee Association for Drug Court Professionals.
Addiction doesn't get solved by simple jail time or punishment of crimes she said. In order to stop the ongoing process of repeat offenses we've got to treat the problem where it is. That's treating the addiction.
Right now in Tennessee that addiction is opioids.
Between 300 and 400 people each year who come into the court programs say that is their drug of choice according to Ellen Abbott director of criminal justice services for the state.

About 75 percent of participants in Norman's court have used opioids or heroin which provides a similar high to pills but is cheaper though it may not be the person's primary addiction leaders say. Abbott said in 2016 208 recovery court participants were primarily addicted to heroin. Two years earlier it was only 94 people.
Norman and Crosson say there is need to expand the programs into rural areas which can have fewer community-based resources such as inpatient treatment providers. Norman's court in Nashville is the only one in the state that provides its own housing. Others turn to community resources. There also is a need to reach more women I really do have people calling me every day begging for beds Norman said.
Statewide recovery court participants spend 12 to 24 months in a program. Norman says that's often years shorter than a prison term and it's cheaper than incarceration when considering daily housing costs. The judge estimates 33000 savings by sending a person through his program.
There are no fences with barbed wire or cells at Davidson County Drug Court. Just long-term treatment that despite a laundry list of strict rules participants believe is helping them beat addiction.
Or as 23-year-old David Faust says helping him learn to feel emotion without turning to substances. He and others in the program want the public to know that this is not a life they chose nor could stop.
When people are kids they don't just grow up and say 'I want to grow up and be a heroin addict'  Faust said.
His addiction started in high school. I ended up smoking a bunch of pot taking pills he said. I started taking stronger pain pills it's like a progression you know. Eventually I started shooting up pills. It was getting pretty expensive and heroin's pretty cheap so it just makes sense to go to heroin.
He worked and lived in Nashville.
It wasn't ever enough money to support my habits. I had to do extra stuff he says. Extra stuff like breaking into houses and cars according to public records.
I've been to a bunch of rehabs before this one he says. But they were like 28-day rehabs. That's no real clean time or anything. So I'd just get out and keep doing the same thing.
He started in drug court in September 2015 when his lawyers presented an ultimatum drug court or prison.
Jail's a lot easier he says. The residential program is strict Men and women do not interact. They work in the kitchen and garden. If someone doesn't do chores their dorm mates can be punished. Often that's a sentence to wear an old-fashioned black-and-white-striped jail jumpsuit.
But it works.
It's probably the worst best thing that's happened to me Faust says.
Around here you really find out what pisses you off. You learn to deal with that in the form of not getting messed up. You also learn what makes you happy.

Two men have been indicted in separate fentanyl-related deaths in Nashville police announced.
Victor Scruggs 35 was indicted on a second-degree murder charge connected with a 2021 fentanyl-related death the Metro Nashville Police Department said in a news release. Smyrna resident Almurtaza Al Zerkani 28 was also indicted on a second-degree murder charge in a separate case for a 2020 fentanyl-related death.
Scruggs indictment
Scruggs' indictment stems from the death of William Young on Feb. 5 2021 police said. Young 40 was a self-employed contractor and found dead in his Nashville home. A medical examiner ruled his cause of death as acute combined drug toxicity involving fentanyl according to MNPD.
Tedious work by Specialized Investigations Division Detective Barry Demonbreun led to evidence that Scruggs sold Young heroin and methamphetamine allegedly laced with fentanyl on the same day of Youngs death the release said.
Scruggs also faces unrelated federal and state weapons charges and remains in custody according to the release.
Al Zerkani indictment
Al Zerkani's charge stems from the death of a woman in South Nashville on Nov. 13 2020 according to the release.

Mily Bolon a 22-year-old mother was found dead in her bedroom in the home she shared with her family police said. A medical examiner ruled her cause of death as acute combined drug toxicity involving fentanyl. She had a 4-year-old son the release said.
An investigation by Detective Chris McIsaac led police to Al Zerkani who they say sold pills to Bolon that looked like oxycodone. Instead those pills had fentanyl in them and were not made by a legitimate pharmaceutical company MNPD said.
Al Zerkis was jailed in lieu of a 100000 bond police said.
Police warn of dangers of fentanyl
Fentanyl is responsible for an increasing number of overdose deaths the release said. It is often found in combination with street drugs like methamphetamine heroin cocaine and marijuana.
A tiny amount of fentanyl can kill the release said.
MNPD said it has a Specialized Investigations Division that works to identify the sellers of fentanyl-laced substances behind overdose cases. Assistant District Attorney Mindy Vinecore also works to prosecute those sellers.
MNPD urges those seeking treatment for drug addiction to contact the Community Overdose Response Center which offers a free and confidential way to find drug and alcohol treatment for those at risk of overdosing. The team will work with people to find the necessary level of care.
You can make a referral or learn more about the response center by calling 615-687-1701.

Tennessee's regional overdose prevention specialists distribute these kits to people who live and work among illicit drug use. Each box of Narcan includes two doses but often two or more doses are required.
Public health officials are encouraging more Tennessee residents to carry the overdose reversal drug naloxone because of a sharp rise in drug deaths. But acquiring doses of the pricey Narcan nasal spray takes some maneuvering.
Andrea Hancock a regional overdose prevention specialist funded by the state spends most of her days training people to use Narcan and distributing two-dose kits  but only to those who need it most.
Naloxone is one of those things youd rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it Hancock says. You never know when youll come across an opioid overdose.
She says her own sons life was spared by Narcan last year. He overdosed after using cocaine laced with fentanyl which is increasingly common and helped lead to another record year of fatal overdoses in 2021.
The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services has distributed 300000 two-dose boxes since October 2017 with 44000 confirmed lives saved according to the agency. Especially with potent fentanyl overdose reversal often requires two doses or more.
The spike in fentanyl-laced drugs has put more demands on the supply. The state uses mostly federal grant money to buy Narcan at 67.50 per unit. The vials of naloxone which require the use of a syringe cost just 3 a piece for the state and are not as widely used.
For those who are regularly around illicit drug use
Regional overdose prevention specialists known as ROPS listed here are the best points of contact. They will come and provide a brief training and  if needed  provide Narcan doses. On Thursday the Main Library in Nashville is hosting a one-hour training at 11 a.m. and offering overdose kits while supplies last. Call 615 862-5815 to register. STARS Nashville will offer more trainings at a community celebration June 11 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at 1704 Charlotte Ave.
Streetworks which runs a needle exchange program also distributes Narcan from both its mobile truck contact here and at its office at 1326B Rosa Parks Blvd in Nashville.
Low-income clinics such as Neighborhood Health will sometimes have Narcan available to hand out though not always.
For those who just want to be prepared
There is a standing order at Tennessee pharmacies which means Narcan is available without a prescription. But its likely not free. Private insurance can cover with a co-pay I just ordered some generic Narcan while writing this paragraph from a Walmart pharmacy with a 10 co-pay though the pharmacist said most insurance limits to one box per month. Starting in July all opioid prescriptions should come with an offer of naloxone under a new state law.
The cost out of pocket can run as high as 150. But Hancock recommends using GoodRx which acts essentially like a coupon and brings the cost down to between 30 and 50.
It can happen to the first-time users. It can happen to experimenters. It can happen to a toddler who accidentally gets into their caretakers medication Hancock says. Weve heard all kinds of stories so we make sure the individuals have access to naloxone in order to save a life.

Sue Goodrum woke up to flashing lights outside her bedroom window after falling asleep early on a winter night in 2016.
Her 33-year-old son Daniel recently paralyzed in a car accident stayed with her at her house in the Frayser neighborhood of Memphis with his girlfriend and their 6-week old son.
A hallway and two closed doors separated Goodrum's room from her son's living space and a fan was blowing to drown out noise. When she saw the ambulance at about 930 p.m. she didn't think that it was coming to her house. But about 15 minutes later a gurney wheeled down her driveway.
I knew then this is Daniel she said. And I jumped up.
Goodrum's son Corey Goodrum known by his nickname Daniel overdosed that night and two people are charged with killing him by unlawfully distributing the heroin.

Putting the pieces together
Gathering the evidence to bring charges after a person dies of an opioid overdose can be a challenge according to Metro Nashville Police Lt. Carlos Lara who leads narcotics investigations within the department's specialized investigations division.
The investigations require backtracking he said because often overdose victims are found alone.
Now were trying to  start putting the pieces together Lara said. Starting to dig deep to figure out who was the last person with this person do we have any information on who this person contacted to get the drugs.

That big heart
Sue Goodrum's son was born in Memphis on August 19 1982. Growing up he liked to fish with his brothers  one older and one younger  at Reelfoot Lake in northwest Tennessee about 100 miles north of Memphis.
A big guy at 6 feet 3 inches he loved sports playing football and basketball.
You knew when he came into a room Goodrum said. He loved to talk and he was going to make sure you heard him because he was loud. Always smiling. Always. He could be dead tired from working or whatever and he would be laughing about it and smiling about it. And very sensitive. Sad movies made him cry. This great big teddy bear but a sad movie is going to make him cry.
His Christian faith was important to him and he was not shy about talking to his friends about Jesus Goodrum said. He especially liked to be kind to the elderly and helped a neighbor who lived alone by mowing her lawn. After any argument with his mother he still called every night to say I love you.
He just had that big heart Goodrum said.
In November 2015 he was injured as a passenger in a car accident at Hollywood and Frayser Boulevard in Memphis breaking his neck in four places. He spent two months at Regional Medical Center and five weeks at a rehab facility unable to move below his chest. Eventually he could move one arm and he started to be able to feed himself.
In February 2016 just days after his release he had a doctor's appointment. But his name got overlooked and the ambulance that was supposed to pick him up didn't come Goodrum said. He had run out of all the medications he had been sent home with.
He decided to use that day she said. He told his girlfriend he was in pain and he wanted to use.
When emergency lights awoke her Goodrum asked her son's girlfriend what was going on.
She said Daniel overdosed on heroin.
The only thing I could think of was why didn't you wake me Goodrum said. If he was in pain we could have taken him to the hospital we could have done anything but that. And you have a baby here. Why didn't you wake me
Her response was she was scared she was scared I would get mad.
The girlfriend 28-year-old Haley High and the suspected dealer 30-year-old Jerrico Long are both charged with second-degree murder in his death.
In a previous case in 2013 18-year-old University of Memphis student Sharon Muir died in a heroin overdose. The state alleged that Eric Herbers bought the heroin to celebrate their one-month anniversary. He pleaded in an agreement for a sentence of eight years.
In another Tennessee case Marvin Pookie Foster was convicted in June of federal charges for selling heroin to a man who overdosed.
Cody E. Tettleton was found unresponsive in his pickup truck July 2 2014 in Halls about 45 miles northwest of Jackson. A farmer saw the truck and called authorities. Foster faces a recommended sentence of 25 years with no parole said U.S. Attorney Michael Dunavant.
At least seven other cases are pending in Shelby County involving people charged in overdose deaths.
Bertrand Ross Tuggle Jr. 53 who was born in Virginia and graduated from Auburn University died last year in Memphis from a lethal mix of fentanyl and heroin after a years long struggle with alcohol and prescription pills. He was found in his car in his driveway.
Two men Aaron Lipford 53 and Justin Slepicka 23 were charged with second-degree murder in his death.
Tuggle's mother Barbara Tuggle had heart problems and she died not long after her son.
What happened to him took a toll on her said her son Allen Tuggle.
To him the second-degree murder charge is more than fair.
In my opinion I think it's very fair and honestly I don't think it's steep enough if you ask me he said. In my opinion it should be life.
In Sumner County northeast of Nashville District Attorney Ray Whitley estimated several such cases had been prosecuted in recent years.
The law has been on the books more than a decade he said but the cases can be tricky because law enforcement must prove how someone got the deadly drugs.
A conviction of second-degree murder carries a possible prison term of 15 to 25 years with no chance at early release he said. He believes that consequence is appropriate for the crime.
Anything we can do to try and deter people from dispensing and using opioids we need to do he said. This is a tool we have and we ought to use it when we have the opportunity.
He believes prosecuting such crimes serves as a deterrent against drug distribution.
Is it effective
The Drug Policy Alliance which opposes the war on drugs and supports a new approach grounded in science compassion health and human rights said most laws charging murder for overdose deaths were passed in the 1980s and were reinvigorated in the wake of increasing overdose deaths in the last few years.
There is absolutely no evidence in support of the effectiveness of these laws for either reducing sales or use or reducing overdoses said Drug Policy Alliance senior staff attorney Lindsay LaSalle.
MoreTales of opioid anguish and a search for answers at Southaven town hall
OpinionWe all have role to play in ending opioid crisis
Instead the policy group argues that such laws actually discourage people from making 911 calls for overdose victims for fear of prosecution.
On the other hand proven strategies are available to reduce the harms associated with drug misuse treat dependence and addiction improve immediate overdose responses enhance public safety and prevent fatalities the group said in a paper.
These strategies include expanding access to the lifesaving medicine naloxone and its associated training improving fact-based drug education for young people that includes an overdose prevention and response component enacting legal protections that encourage people to call for help for overdose victims training people how to prevent recognize and respond to an overdose increasing access to medication-assisted treatment including methadone and buprenorphine and implementing safe injection facilities.
In shock
Daniel Goodrum had previously struggled with addiction. At some point  his mom thinks in high school he started drinking and when he got older he developed a problem with pain pills. When they got too expensive he turned to heroin Sue Goodrum said.
The night of the overdose a detective came separating Goodrum and her husband from the girlfriend. The detective told Goodrum he was sorry. Her son didn't survive.
I can just still hear those words Goodrum said. You know they ring in your head. 'I'm sorry your son didn't make it.'
She went outside her house and started hitting the walls of the ramp that had been built for her son after his accident.
She was in shock.
But you have to hold yourself together she said. So that's what you do.

Listen
The big hospital chains based in Nashville are accepting some of the blame for the countrys opioid crisis which grows more deadly by the year. They admit they were going overboard with opioids to make people as pain-free as possible. So in an effort to be part of the cure theyre issuing an uncomfortable warning to patients  youre going to feel some pain.
Even for those whove never struggled with drug abuse
studies are finding that patients are at risk of addiction
anytime they go under the knife.
I had the c-section had the kiddo says Michelle Leavy of Las Vegas. And then they tell me its ok you can keep taking the pain medications its fine.'
Leavy is a mother of three and a paramedic who has dealt with many addicts herself. She welcomed the high-dose intravenous narcotics while she was in the hospital. And as she went home she gladly followed doctors orders and kept ahead of the pain with her Percocet pills.
But then she needed stronger doses. And pretty soon she realized she was no longer treating pain.
Before I went to work I took them and to get the kids after school I had to take them she says. Then I was taking them just to go to bed. I didnt really realize I had a problem until the problem was something more than I could have taken care of myself.
She was becoming like the addicts she transported by ambulance lying to emergency room doctors to con a few extra doses.
Pretty soon she lost her job and her fiancï¿½ before going to rehab through Nashville-based American Addiction Centers and stitching her life back together.
A 180 On Opioids
Its a reality that has been completely disconnected from where it often starts  in a hospital. Anesthesiologist David Alfery in Nashville says he was rarely stingy with opioids.
If I could awaken them without any pain whatsoever I was the slickest guy on the block and it was a matter of enormous pride he says.
Alferys part of a working group at the Nashville-based consulting firm Health Trust where hospitals have set aside some of their competitive interests to swap ideas.
It starts with patient expectations and I think over the years patients have come to expect more and more in terms of I dont want any pain after surgery and its an unrealistic expectation Alfery says.
That expectation exists in part because pain treatment was institutionalized. Hospitals
have been graded on how well they keep someones pain at bay. And doctors can feel some pressure.
I just wanted my patient not to be in pain thinking I was doing the right thing for them and certainly not an outlier among my colleagues says Mike Schlosser chief medical officer for HCAs national group of hospitals.
Schlosser spent a decade as a spinal surgeon putting his patients at HCAs flagship facility Centennial Medical Center through some of the most painful procedures in medicine like correcting back curvature. He says he genuinely just wanted to soothe the hurt he caused.
But now looking back on it I was putting them at significant risk for developing an addiction to those medications he says.
Looking at company-wide data for the largest for-profit hospital chain in the country hes found that for orthopedic and back surgeries the greatest risk isnt infection or some other complication  its addiction.
So HCA is rolling out a new protocol prior to surgery. It includes a conversation Schlosser basically never had when he was practicing medicine.
We will treat the pain but you should expect that youre going to have some pain. And you should also understand that taking a narcotic so that you have no pain really puts you at risk of becoming addicted to that narcotic Schlosser tells patients.
Besides issuing the uncomfortable warning limiting opioids also takes more work on the hospitals part  trying nerve blocks and finding the most effective blend of non-narcotics. Then after surgery the nursing staff has to stick to it. If someone can get up and walk and cough without doubling over maybe they dont need narcotics.
Managing The Optics
Of course business-wise no one wants to be the hospital where it hurts more.
You dont want to portray the fact that youre not going to treat people appropriately says John Young national medical director of cardiovascular services for LifePoint Hospitals. The Brentwood-based hospital chain is putting special emphasis on how it handles people coming into the ER looking for pain medicine.
Young says tightening up on opioids is a delicate matter but its the right thing to do.
We really do have a lot of responsibility and culpability and this burden and so we have to make sure we do whatever we can to stem this tide and turn the ship in the other direction he says.
While hospitals get their ship in order some patients are taking personal responsibility.
Now that shes in recovery Michelle Leavy wont touch opioids. That meant she had emergency gallbladder surgery in 2017 without any narcotics. She says it can be done.
I mean it hurt she says. But I lived.

When a Bearden homeowners association blew the whistle on the high levels of opiates a Food City grocery store pharmacy was shelling out to pill mill patients the companys chief executive officer called it a lie.
When a Knoxville weekly newsmagazine reported the Westwood Homeowners Associations claims and exposed a slew of opiate-related crimes in the same pharmacys parking lot  as well as its ties to a Bearden pill mill  Food City Chief Executive Officer Steve Smith threatened to pull its advertising from the publications owner.
When the Tennessee Attorney Generals office filed a lawsuit last year chockfull of Food City internal records backing up the associations claims and the Metro Pulse reporting the firm labeled the litigation a smack in the face to grocery store workers everywhere.
Now with a judge refusing the firms bid to have that lawsuit tossed and the records underlying it destroyed Food City is again on the attack branding a laundry list of citizens companies state and federal regulators and leaders equally guilty in fueling the opioid epidemic.
Food City a grocery chain with 2.5 billion in annual sales and 130 stores in Tennessee Virginia and Kentucky is now claiming comparative fault in defense of the states lawsuit records reviewed by the Tennessee Lookout.
The firm argues in its motion that even if the grocery store intentionally sought to profiteer from opioids there are lots of dirty hands in the creation of an epidemic that claims the lives of more than 3000 Tennesseans annually.
For instance the state of Tennessee the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners were informed about the prescribing frequencies of all prescribing physicians and health care providers licensed by the state of Tennessee the motion stated.
Despite the state of Tennessee having records of all opioids being dispensed in Tennessee the state of Tennessee took little to no action to prevent physicians and medical providers from overprescribing opiates the motion stated.
The motion blames federal authorities including the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration for failing to police opioid makers and distributors doctors for overprescribing the addictive painkillers Food Citys competitors for seizing the opportunity to profiteer from overprescribing doctors pill mills for catering to addicts and citizens for abusing the pills.
Each of those groups the firm insisted in the motion should bear blame alongside Food City and pay a share in any damages a jury might assess the grocery chain.
A hearing on that motion and other matters in the states lawsuit against the grocery chain is set for Wednesday in Knox County Circuit Court.
Trappings of legitimacy
The state contends the comparative fault claim is just another example of the grocery chains aggressive tactics to both profiteer from opioid addiction and silence its critics.
The states lawsuit relies upon firms own records including email exchanges between Smith and other corporate officers to detail Food Citys rise from independent grocer catering to rural Appalachian communities to one of the regions biggest grocery chains via those tactics.
One of the ways that Food City has been able to compete against larger market players is with opioids the lawsuit stated. Other considerations aside opioids offer money-making opportunities that other pharmaceutical products do not.
As a medium-sized regional supermarket chain Food City found itself in an apparent sweet spot smaller than major pharmacy chains that attracted attention and resources from the DEA and the Department of Justice but much larger than independent pharmacies which often attracted the attention from local law enforcement.  Lawsuit filed by Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery
On the grocery side of its business Food City exists within an industry that is highly competitive and that operates on tight margins the lawsuit stated. As part of an intentional corporate-driven strategy to maximize profit centers elsewhere Food City zeroed in on opioid sales at its in-store pharmacies and engaged in a series of unlawful acts that led it to become one of the biggest sellers of highly-diverted opioids in Tennessee.
Food City sold opioids by filling prescriptions written by high-volume providers and pill mills that most of its competitors would not sell the lawsuit continued. The company also sold opioids in combinations  labeled the holy trinity of opioids anti-anxiety medication and muscle relaxers  that most of its competitors would not sell and that its own compliance auditors told Food City and its executives were sought by those who illicitly seek pain medications.
Over the last 15 years Food City has sold massive quantities of opioids has continued to fail to maintain effective controls against diversion and has taken affirmative steps to undermine its own opioid diversion controls and those of others the lawsuit stated.
According to records contained in the lawsuit Food City executives partnered with opioid suppliers to fly below the DEAs radar by gaming order thresholds used multiple suppliers to keep the addictive drugs flowing and pushed its pharmacists to fill as many opioid prescriptions as they could.
The firm offered discounts to opiate addicts traded prescriptions for cash partnered with notorious pill-mill operators ignored drug deals and drug-related crimes in pharmacy parking lots and filled opiate prescriptions from other countries and states as far away as Hawaii the lawsuit alleged.
Food City actively partnered with known pill mills that directed their patients to have their prescription filled at Food City  something that its larger competitors would not do or were reluctant to do the lawsuit stated.
As a result of corporate directives that emphasized the profit potential of opioids Food City quickly became known as the pharmacy where you could purchase massive quantities of opioids cheaply and with minimal hassle the lawsuit stated.
Food City used the trappings of legitimacy from its grocery store business in part to become an outlier of outliers even among high-volume opioid sellers the lawsuit continued. As a medium-sized regional supermarket chain Food City found itself in an apparent sweet spot smaller than major pharmacy chains that attracted attention and resources from the DEA and the Department of Justice but much larger than independent pharmacies which often attracted the attention from local law enforcement.
CEO proud of our Food City pharmacies
The lawsuit and Food Citys internal records also lay bare the details surrounding the firms reaction to the first media account of potential problems with the grocery chains relationship with a notorious pill mill in Bearden  then known as Bearden HealthCare Associates  whose owner was later prosecuted federally.
The Westwood Homeowners Association whose residents lived near the Bearden pill mill and the Food City pharmacy that catered to it had complained about both in a monthly newsletter.
According to experts within the Knoxville Police Department Bearden Food City pharmacy dispenses the highest volume of narcotic drugs in the state of Tennessee the newsletter stated. According to eyewitnesses and police reports during the spring of 2008 some pharmacy customers were mugged as they left the store and their prescriptions stolen some at gunpoint. Several shoppers had observed drug deals taking place in the parking lot.
The Metro Pulse which is now shuttered weeks later published an article entitled Drug Zone that confirmed the validity of the claims in the Westwood newsletter and added more claims of wrongdoing by Food City and the Bearden pill mill.
Bearden and Food City both responded forcefully to the Metro Pulse article after its publication the states lawsuit stated. Bearden  filed a libel suit against members of the Westwood Homeowners Association based on the four paragraphs contained in the neighborhood news bulletin. The lawsuit was later dismissed.
Food City CEO Smith penned an open letter he insisted be published in the Metro Pulse in its entirety. In it he called comments from Westwood residents reckless and unfounded.
I cannot let the libelous publication of unsubstantiated rumors go without an appropriate response he wrote. We are all very proud of our Food City pharmacies. Food City Pharmacy associates are truly healthcare professionals  Im at a loss to know how to completely satisfy someone who expresses dislike for any pharmacy operating close to their home because it might attract undesirables as suggested by the resident.
Food City is in the business to serve all Knoxville area customers not judge them Smith said.
According to the lawsuit Smith also threatened to pull future advertising by Food City in the Knoxville News Sentinel which through its parent company E.W. ScrippsCompany owned the Metro Pulse at the time.
The lawsuit and Food Citys internal records reveal Food Citys Bearden pharmacy not only partnered with the Bearden pill mill to fill its suspect prescriptions but threw a party for the clinic to keep its business. The lawsuit also shows Food City quietly settled a wrongful death lawsuit involving dispensing to Bearden pill-mill patients around the same time as the Westwood complaints.
Zombie apocalypse
Emails contained in the lawsuit also show the grocery chains own pharmacists questioned the filling of prescriptions from pill mills and overprescribing doctors  and complained about criminal activity both inside and outside the pharmacies.
In one email a pharmacist at a Food City store in Bristol offered a blunt assessment of what would happen if the grocery chain tightened down on its supply of opiates.
This is phase one of the zombie apocalypse the unidentified pharmacist wrote. Phase two is increased robberies and other violent crimes. Drug addicts move to whatever other drug is available.
The ones who shift to bath salts become temporary zombies super-strong incoherent etc. the pharmacist wrote. If you havent seen bath salt highs watch one or two on YouTube. At this time we thought the movies were fantasy. Get prepared and have a nice day.
A Food City representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesdays hearing and the comparative fault claim.
Food City spokeswoman Tammy Baumgardner has said in a previous statement issued when the states lawsuit was filed last year that the grocery chain is innocent and the lawsuit claims false.
Food City recognized during the relevant time period that a few of its pharmacies dispensed a high volume of pain management prescriptions Baumgardner wrote.
Therefore the company contracted with independent auditors and experts in pharmacy best practices to assure that its dispensing practices were compliant with all state and federal regulations the statement read.
The lawsuit against Food City is the fourth in a chain of legal actions filed by Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery III and his staff against drug makers distributors prescribers and dispensers.
Slatery has said the lawsuits represent an effort to claw back profits from those responsible for Tennessees opioid epidemic to offset what it has cost the state to deal with it. The effort has been spearheaded by Senior Assistant Attorney General Brant Harrell and Assistant Attorneys General Margaret Rowland and Robert Mitchell.
The trio are using the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act and the states public nuisance laws as underpinning and internal records acquired through investigative subpoenas as evidence.
NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  It's a heartbreaking statistic in the year 2022 nearly 4000 Tennesseans died from a drug overdose. Lawmakers are hoping to pass legislation that can bring that number down significantly. But figuring out that solution drew a lot of debate Tuesday on Tennessee's Capitol Hill.
Brittany's Law
Jessica Francis a Maury County resident testified on behalf of Brittany's Law.
My sister passed away on June 12 2023. My sister died while laying in a camper for hours. 10 other people were there and didnt seek help Francis said. If you are going to let someone die wheres your humanity
The bill would make it a criminal offense if someone knowingly failed to seek medical assistance for someone overdosing. It would be a misdemeanor offense. But experts worry the bill could do the exact opposite.
Its well intended. Unfortunately its very likely to backfire testified Elliot Pinsley CEO of the Behavioral Health Foundation. We want bystanders to call 911 as quickly as possible and having to worry about when immunity might apply versus when a criminal penalty might apply is not something we want people thinking about when were trying to save a life.
Melody Clark who lost her daughter to a fatal overdose agreed.
I just feel like this is going in the opposite direction of the Good Samaritan law. I feel like these people need to know they can call and not get into trouble for saving someones life said Clark who lives in Signal Mountain.
Many of the House Criminal Justice Subcommittee lawmakers felt like the bill was well-intentioned but ultimately decided that the unintended consequences were just too great. How do you define and criminalize that Its so hard said Rep. William Lamberth R-Portland who serves as House Majority Leader.
To expect one of those persons to make a judgment call that sound I think is really stretching it said Rep. Bud Hulsey R-Kingsport who is retired law enforcement.
Ultimately the support just wasn't there. All but one member Rep. G.A. Hardaway D-Memphis voted against the measure. But the bill sponsor Rep. Scott Cepicky R-Culleoka hopes finding a solution will remain a number one priority.
Members if this isnt the solution I understand that. Okay. Then what is asked Cepicky.
Other Opioid Epidemic Bills and Ideas
Rep. Yusef Hakeem and Sen. Heidi Campbellhave a bill that would require a prescribing healthcare practitioner to discuss certain risks associated with prescribing opiates.
Elliot Pinsley who testified Tuesday against Brittany's Law suggested that the best way to save lives would be to add exceptions to Tennessee's Good Samaritan Law. The measure which passed in 2015 has a provision that only gives one criminal exception to someone who has previously overdosed. He thinks giving full immunity to those trying to save others from an overdose would encourage everyone to seek help.
White people have accounted for nealry 90 percent of the overdose deaths in Tennessee until the last few years. Credit Blake FarmerWPLN
Listen
Overdose deaths among African-Americans in Tennessee have roughly doubled since 2012. Fatalities from opioids are still growing among whites in the state but deaths among blacks are surging twice as fast.
Figures from the states health department show blacks accounted for just 15 percent of all overdose deaths in the most recent year data is available. But that masks that the number of blacks dying from opioids is rising fast. In 2012 black deaths were just eight percent of overdose fatalities in Tennessee.
Lloyda Williamson chairs the psychiatry department at Meharry Medical College which specializes in minority communities. Shes only recently secured her license to prescribe medication-assisted treatment to opioid abusers. Shes concerned that opioid addiction might have been disregarded as a white problem.
Part of the difficulty is the lack of knowledge of people understanding how quickly one can become addicted and how quickly one can move from appropriate prescriptions to inappropriate use and over use and abuse she says.
Theres no clear-cut explanation for why opioids are moving more into black communities but Williamson says its obvious why they started among whites.
When you look at the history of how this crisis has gone what it really indicates is that for a number of years white individuals were more frequently prescribed opiate painkillers when you compared that to black or African-American patients she says. What it appears has happened is African-Americans are now having more access to those pain medications.
However new opioid abusers are getting in at a time when the drug is even more dangerous with many counterfeit pills laced with high-powered fentanyl. In Boston experts on the street fear African-Americans may be even more likely to end up with tainted drugs.
According to figures kept by the Centers for Disease Control Tennessee is among five states and Washington D.C. where overdose deaths for African Americans doubled in just a two year period.
Naloxone a life-saving drug used to reverse opioid overdoses may soon be as easy to get as Tylenol or aspirin. By summer 2023 naloxone could be available in vending machines supermarkets and convenience stores and as a result thousands of opioid-related overdose deaths could be averted.
In March 2023 the Food and Drug Administration approved naloxone nasal sprayalso known by the brand name Narcanfor sale over the counter or without a prescription. Higher dosages and some other forms of naloxone will still only be available with a prescription.
States have not had the authority to designate naloxone as an over-the-counter medication but have implemented workarounds such as statewide Standing Orders to make it easier to access. These workarounds however do not apply to organizations that purchase naloxone in bulk from drugmakers such as hospitals and harm-reduction groups. In settings such as these naloxone is treated as a prescription medication.
While most states have made naloxone available without a prescription it still must be obtained through a pharmacist. Making naloxone available over the counter will help combat the stigma associated with drug use by removing the need to obtain a prescription or talk to a pharmacist and eliminating fear or confusion around immunity laws for people prescribing dispensing and administering naloxone.
Drug overdose deaths reached a record 107000 deaths in 2021 with opioid-related overdose deaths accounting for nearly 81000 according to the Centers for Disease Control.
A 2017 National Institute on Drug Abuse statistical analysis found that higher rates of naloxone distribution among laypersonsanyone not a medical professionaland emergency personnel could prevent 21 of opioid overdose deaths. The study notes that most of the lives saved would be attributed to family friends and other laypersons having access to naloxone. The vast majority of naloxone doses are administered by emergency medical personnel.
Opioids attach themselves to the part of the brain that regulates breathing. When a person overdoses their breathing can be slowed or stopped eventually leading to death. Naloxone reverses overdoses by clearing the brain's receptors to which opioids were attached.
Naloxone has been found to be safe and effective in reversing overdoses even in infants with almost no potential for misuse or abuse. Equally as important as access is ease of use. Naloxone does not require medical training to administer.
Yet even with over-the-counter access the cost may still be a significant barrier for some people with Narcan retailing for as much as 60 for a single-use kit.
Stacker investigated the potential impact of over-the-counter naloxone on the opioid crisis in Tennessee using data from KFF and Legislative Analysis and Public Policy Association. Overdose death rate data is age-adjusted and was collected in 2021. Data about naloxone regulations was collected in January 2023.
Over-the-counter Naloxone and its potential impact on the opioid crisis in Tennessee
- All drug overdose death rate per 100000 56.6
--- Opioid drug overdose death rate per 100000 45.5
- Existing access to Naloxone without prescription statewide standing order
- Co-prescribing requirements may notify the patient about naloxone but not required to co-prescribe
- Immunity laws
--- For prescribers civil and professional immunity
--- For dispensers civil and professional immunity
--- For laypeople civil immunity only
NASHVILLE Tenn. Spring cleaning season is here and people across Tennessee are preparing to clean out their medicine cabinets and safely and securely dispose of medications that are expired or no longer needed during National Prescription Drug Take Back Day. Take Back Day is this Saturday April 30 from 1000 a.m. to 200 p.m. local time.
During the October 2021 Take Back Day Tennesseans safely and securely disposed of nearly 17000 pounds of medications at 112 sites across the state. In the decade that the Drug Enforcement Agency has organized Take Back Day Tennesseans have safely and securely disposed of more than 330000 pounds of medications.
Find a Take Back Day event or permanent prescription drop box at this link
The bi-annual medication collection event comes as authorities from the DEA to the TBI are warning of the danger of counterfeit prescription pills that are laced with fentanyl. The DEA estimates that four out of every 10 counterfeit pills bought on the street or over the internet or social media apps contain a lethal dose of fentanyl.
Thats having deadly consequences across the country but the effects are most strongly felt among young adults and teens. Overdose deaths among American teens nearly doubled from 2019 to 2020 and researchers estimate the 2021 numbers will show another 20 increase in overdose deaths. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show fentanyl overdose deaths among teens increased by nearly 170 in just one year.
Safely disposing of unwanted pharmaceuticals at drop-off locations across the state helps ensure medicines are not misused or accidentally taken by someone they were unintended for.
KFF Health News 
Over the past two years rural Greene County in northeastern Tennessee has collected more than 2.7 million from regional and national settlements with opioid manufacturers and distributors. But instead of helping people harmed by addiction county officials are finding other ways to spend it.
They have put 2.4 million toward paying off the countys debt and have directed another 1 million arriving over more than a decade into a capital projects fund. In March they appropriated 50000 from that fund to buy a litter crew vehicle  a pickup truck to drive inmates to collect trash along county roads.
Its astounding said Nancy Schneck a retired nurse who has seen addiction infiltrate the community where employers avoid drug testing for fear of losing too many employees and mental health crises and homelessness are rampant. She wants to see the money go toward mental health and addiction treatment. Why cant county leaders see treating some people and maybe getting them out of this cycle might be advantageous she said.
In 2021 the latest year for which comparable data is available Greene Countys rate of drug overdose deaths topped state and national figures.
Greene County Tenn. resident Nancy Schneck wants opioid settlement funds to be used for addiction and mental health treatment. She says it's astounding that most of the money so far has gone to repaying county debt. Paul Ferrari
But Mayor Kevin Morrison said the county has borne the costs of the opioid epidemic for years It has funded a beleaguered sheriffs office improved the jail  which is packed with people whove committed addiction-related crimes  and supported a drug court to divert some people to treatment. It has also suffered indirect costs of the crisis people dropping out of the workforce due to addiction schools and welfare services caring for more children whove experienced trauma and some taxpayers leaving the county altogether. Addiction is not the sole reason for Greene Countys economic woes but it has contributed to more than 30 million of debt.
Weve been dealing with this crisis for quite some time but nobody wants to pay the bill as it comes Morrison said. So when these funds are made available then we are paying bills that have been due for quite some time.
The debate in this Appalachian county is reverberating nationwide as state and local governments receive billions of dollars from companies that made distributed or sold opioid painkillers like Johnson  Johnson Cardinal Health and CVS. The companies were accused of fueling the overdose epidemic and the money is meant to remediate that harm. About 3 billion has already landed in state county and city coffers and about 50 billion more is expected in the coming decade and beyond.
States are required to spend at least 85 of the money on opioid-related programs but KFF Health News ongoing investigation into how the cash is used  and misused  shows there is wide interpretation of that standard and little oversight.
That restriction didnt apply to the money Greene County moved to its capital projects fund.
In many rural communities which have been struggling to pay addiction-related costs for decades local officials justify using the settlement funds to reimburse past expenses. Most of Tennessees 95 counties are in significant debt which can present difficult choices about how to use this money said Robert Pack co-director of East Tennessee State Universitys Addiction Science Center.
Still he and many advocates hope the settlement funds are spent on tackling the current crisis. After all more than 200 people nationwide are dying of overdoses each day. Investing in treatment and prevention can save lives and protect future generations they say.
There is no good excuse to sit on the funds or put them into a general fund said Tricia Christensen policy director for the nonprofit Community Education Group. The organization is tracking settlement spending across Appalachia which Christensen called the epidemics ground zero. These dollars should be used to support people who have been most impacted by the overdose crisis.
Nationally there has been little oversight of the settlement dollars. President Joe Bidens administration pledged to ensure the funds went toward tackling the addiction crisis but has taken little action. Accountability at the state level varies.
In Tennessee 15 of the states opioid settlement funds are controlled by the legislature and another 15 by local governments. Those two buckets have few restrictions.
The other 70 is controlled by an Opioid Abatement Council which has more rigorous standards. When the council which must give 35 of its funds to local governments recently distributed more than 31 million to counties it required the funds be spent on a list of approved interventions such as building recovery housing and increasing addiction treatment for uninsured people.
I can guarantee were going to bird-dog those funds said Stephen Loyd chair of the council and a physician in recovery from opioid addiction. If counties use them for unapproved purposes the counties will not receive future payouts he said.
Greene County Tenn. is directing some of its opioid settlement money into the county's capital projects fund. In March 50000 from that fund was appropriated to buy a litter crew vehicle a pickup truck used to drive inmates assigned to collect trash by the side of the road. The new truck is not in use yet but looks just like this white truck the sheriff's office said. Greene County Sheriff's Office
Greene Countys reimbursement of its capital projects fund comes from its own pot  the 15 that is controlled entirely by local governments.
In such cases the public can hold officials accountable Loyd said. If you dont like the way the money is being spent you have the ability to vote.
Local leaders are generally not being nefarious with these decisions he said. They make hundreds of budgetary choices a month and simply dont have experience with addiction or health policy to guide them in using the money.
Loyd and other local experts are trying to fill that gap. He meets with county officials and recommends they speak with their local anti-drug coalitions or hold listening sessions to hear from community members. Pack from East Tennessee State urges them to increase access to medications that have proven effective in treating opioid addiction.
Both men point counties to an online recovery ecosystem index where leaders can see how their areas resources for recovery compare with those of others.
In Greene County for example the index indicates there are no recovery residences and the number of treatment facilities and mental health providers per 100000 residents is below state and national averages.
Thats a great place to get started Loyd said.
Some Greene County residents want to see opioid settlement funds go to local initiatives that are already operating on the ground. The Greene County Anti-Drug Coalition for instance hosts presentations to educate young people and their parents on the risks of drug use. They meet with convenience store owners to reinforce the importance of not selling alcohol cigarettes or vaping devices to minors. In the future the coalition hopes to offer classes on life skills such as how to budget and make decisions under pressure.
If we can do prevention work with kids we can change the trajectory of their lives as adults said Wendy Peay secretary of the anti-drug coalition and executive director of United Way of Greene County.
The coalition has asked the county for settlement funds but has not received any yet.
Nearby in Carter County a new residential treatment facility is taking shape at the site of a former prison. At least seven counties cities and towns in the region have committed a combined 10 million in opioid settlement funds to support it said Stacy Street a criminal court judge who came up with the idea. Greene County is among the few local governments that did not contribute.
The facility which Street said he expects to open this summer will initially house 45 people for stays of a year or longer. It will be part of the regions drug recovery court system in which people with addiction who have committed crimes are diverted to intensive treatment instead of prison.
Currently there are no long-term residential facilities in the area for such patients Street said. Too often people in his court receive treatment during the day but return home at night to the same sandbox playing with the same sand-mates increasing their risk of relapse.
Street said the new facility will not offer medications to treat opioid addiction  the gold standard of medical care  because of security concerns. But some patients may be taken to receive them off campus.

Morrison the Greene County mayor said he worried about contributing to the facility because it is a recurring cost and the settlement funds will stop flowing in 2038.
Theres been great pressure put on local entities like Greene County to try to solve this problem with this limited amount of funding he said when the federal government which has the ability to print money to solve these problems is not in this business.
The county is still deciding how to spend nearly 334000 of settlement funds it recently received from the states Opioid Abatement Council. Morrison said theyre considering using it for the anti-drug coalitions education efforts and the county drug court. Given the guidelines from the abatement council these funds cant be used to pay old debts.
MIKE CHRISTEN mchristenc-dh.net
A former Columbia doctor pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful distribution of controlled substances in Federal Court on Monday in a victory for the nation's ongoing battle against the misuse of opioids.
Dr. Darrel Rinehart who was previously affiliated with Maury Regional Medical Group until 2016 and later moved to Indiana where he continued to practice admitted Monday that in January 2016 he knowingly distributed hydrocodone a Schedule II controlled substance to a patient who did not have any significant underlying health issues justifying such a prescription.
A statement from the Department of Justice and United States Attorney Donald Q. Cochran of the Middle District of Tennessee also indicated Rinehart further admitted to distributing Schedule II controlled substances primarily opioids to four different patients without a legitimate medical purpose and outside the course of professional practice on 18 other occasions between December 2014 and December 2015.
The former local doctor is planned to be sentenced on July 30 2020 by Chief U.S. District Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw Jr. He faces up to 20 years in prison and up to a 1 million fine according to the federal department.
The Office of Inspector General U.S. Department of Health and Human Services The Tennessee Bueaur of Investigation and the District Attorney General for the Tennessee's 22nd Judicial District investigated the case.
Assistant Chief Kilby Macfadden and Trial Attorney William M. Grady of the Criminal Division's Fraud Section are prosecuting the case.
In March Rinehart 64 was indicted on 19 counts of prescribing controlled substances without a legitimate medical purpose after at least four of his patients died from drug overdoses according to a news release from the Department of Justice.
He was one of 32 Tennessee doctors and
medical professionals charged with crimes related to over-prescribing opioids in the national crackdown on individuals who prescribed addictive medications without justification.
After Rinehart was caught on undercover video increasing a patient's opioid prescription without any examination by a member by the Maury County Sheriff's Department the Columbia doctor's medical license was suspended by the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners.
Maury Regional Medical Group previously said it employed Dr. Rinehart as well as other physicians of CORE Physicians an independent Columbia medical practice starting September 1 2015. Rinehart's employment was terminated approximately 15 months later on Nov. 22 2016 a spokesperson from the medical center said.
A local drug task force sent in an informant and acquired various painkillers from Rinehart who did not conduct any sort of examination of the undercover agent District Attorney Brent Cooper previously told The Daily Herald.
Because federal charges carry more time Cooper and his office chose to not prosecute Rinehart including a reckless homicide change the district attorney's office was investigating.
I am glad to see that he is being held accountable for his habits of over prescribing these dangerous drugs Cooper said Monday. He will never be able to dispense drugs again and cause harm to others.
Cooper said he would have preferred to see the federal charge include homicide.
I hope that this will give the families of these victims some peace and satisfaction as the death of their loved ones allowed us to collect the evidence that likely led to his prosecution Cooper said. Opioids are still a huge problem and causing death on a daily basis.
Although charges connected the former Columbia doctor to four fatal overdoses an investigation carried out by The Tennessean and The Indianapolis Star indicate at least five of Rinehart's patients died due to drugs he prescribed between March 2015 and January 2016. Another six patients suffered nonfatal overdoses between 2014 and 2016 according to the investigation.
Rinehart told the medical board he was ignorant of safe prescribing laws the Associated Press reported.
The charges against the former local doctor are part of a national crackdown which included 60 medical professionals from seven states in what is considered to be the single-largest prescription opioid law enforcement operation in U.S. history.
With a total of 32 medical professionals charged from the Volunteer State more than half of the 60 defendants in the national operation are from Tennessee. Nine people are facing charges from Middle Tennessee following the national operation.
Jeff Young a nurse practitioner from Jackson is accused of trading fentanyl patches for sex.
Dr. Timothy Abbott a South Nashville Podiatrist is charged with seven counts of prescribing a controlled substance without a legitimate medical purpose
Medical professionals in Kentucky Louisiana Ohio West Virginia Alabama and Pennsylvania were all charged in the massive takedown. Across all states the suspects included 31 doctors seven pharmacists eight nurse practitioners and seven other licensed medical professionals according to a Department of Justice news release.
The opioid epidemic is the deadliest drug crisis in American history and Appalachia has suffered the consequences more than perhaps any other region said U.S. Attorney General William Barr in a press release on the operation. But the Department of Justice is doing its part to help end this crisis.
With a total of 6052014 painkiller prescriptions across the state there were 1304 deaths caused by opiod overdoses in 2018 according to a report from the Tennessee Department of Health.
Last year 23 people died from drug overdoses in Maury County 18 which were opioid overdose deaths and 3 involved heroine.
In 2017 the county recorded 246 nonfatal overdose outpatient visits and 96 nonfatal overdose inpatient stays.
The department indicates nearly three fourths of drug overdose deaths in Tennessee in 2017 were associated with opioids. There were 1268 overdose deaths associated with all opioids and of those 644 were associated with prescription opioids for pain which include drugs such as hydrocodone oxycodone morphine and codeine. Those drugs were associated with more overdose deaths than any other group of drugs for the year.
In 2014 a total of 1263 died from drug-related overdoses in the state. In 2015 that number increased to 1451 and again in 2016 to 1631 with an estimated 432000 people in need of recovery resources. Drug overdoses are also the number one cause of death of people under age 55.
Correction A previous version of this story misstated the date range reported by Metro Public Health. Davidson County reported 10 overdose deaths between May 30 and June 5 2019.
A spike in recent fatal overdoses could be tied to fentanyl-laced drugs in Davidson County public safety officials have warned
Between May 30 and June 10 the Davidson County Medical Examiner's office has investigated at least 10 deaths believed to be fatal drug overdoses according to Metro Public Health.
Of those deaths half have been associated with an unknown white or brown powder .
Tox screens are pending but we know drug dealers are mixing heroin and cocaine with cheaper and deadly fentanyl the Metro Nashville Police Department said in a Twitter post.
In 2018 the medical examiner's office reported 344 drug-related overdoses in the county or just less than one per day. Since May 31 there have been on average more than 1.5 likely overdose deaths per day according to the data from Metro Health.
While the exact causes of the deaths have not been confirmed MNPD and Metro Health hope to warn users and the public about the growing threat.
How deadly is fentanyl in Nashville
Pharmaceutical fentanyl is a synthetic opioid pain reliever approved for treating severe pain typically advanced cancer pain according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine.
Most recent cases of fentanyl-related overdoses and death are from illegally-made fentanyl which is often mixed into heroin or cocaine sometimes without the users knowledge the CDC said.
Statewide 1776 Tennesseans died in drug overdoses in 2017 up from 1631 the prior year according data released by the Tennessee Department of Health last year. It marks at least the sixth year in a row that the death toll rose.
In 2017 105 people in Nashville suffered fatal overdoses with fentanyl in their bloodstream  four more than the overdose total for heroin  according to data released last May by city police and the Metro Public Health Department.
Although the margin between the death tolls is small officials are most concerned about the swift rise of the fentanyl which has spread through the city faster than heroin ever did.
Fentanyl-related overdoses were nearly unheard of in Nashville only a few years ago but deaths rose 250 percent in 2015 then 54 percent in 2016 and 75 percent in 2017.
How to help during an overdose
If there is an immediate health crisis residents are encouraged to call 911 or go to the emergency room.
In 2014 Tennessee passed the Good Samaritan Law allowing residents to become trained in the use of Naxolone or Narcan a medicine that can help sustain the life of someone overdosing until more complete medical care is available.
For more information on how to become trained in the use of Naxolone visit hwww.tn.govhealthhealth-program-areashealth-professional-boardscsmd-boardcsmd-boardnaloxone-training-information.

Health care professionals in Tennessee last year wrote more than 7.8 million opioid prescriptions  or 1.18 for every man woman and child  even as the state grapples with a scourge of painkiller addiction and abuse.
The total places Tennessee second in the nation behind only Alabama in prescriptions of the drugs according to IMS Health data. Even though the number of scripts has fallen by 724070 since 2013 when there were over 8.5 million total prescriptions the state remains ensconced as a leader in prescribing oxycodone hydrocodone and Percocet.
The state along with the nation is in an opioid epidemic. In 2014 still the latest year available 1263 Tennesseans died from opioid overdose  be it painkillers or heroin  a figure that outpaces those who died in car accidents or from firearms.
But what does 7800947 prescriptions mean Why are there so many prescriptions And why wont prescribers just stop writing them
There are 6.5 million people living in Tennessee and there are 38.8 million people living in California where there was 0.48 prescriptions in 2015 for every person.
I truly do not believe that we are skewed toward a higher level of pain or a lower level of pain tolerance than the rest of the country said Dr. Richard Soper of the Center for Behavioral Wellness in Nashville.
The answer to the chagrin of policymakers in all corners of health care is a combination of several factors including accepted medical practice and education successful pharmaceutical advertising campaigns insurance benefit coverage structure and patient lifestyle. There are also several layers of economic dependence.
Pro-painkiller echo chamber shaped policy amid drug epidemic
Its hard to pinpoint one bad actor or even a single group of bad actors when every part of the system and society needs to be examined said Soper noting how he's bombarded with drug ads when he watches TV.
There are consistently positive signs that prescribing habits are changing and that the state is making in-roads into the epidemic said Dr. David Reagan chief medical officer of the Tennessee Department of Health.
Tennessee was one of four states to receive the making progress designation in a recent report from the National Safety Council on efforts to curb opioid abuse and misuse. It met five of six criteria no state met all six.
Drugmakers fought state opioid limits amid crisis
The health department has asked physicians to write prescriptions with fewer doses so there are fewer leftover pills. Its important to balance the legitimate uses of the painkillers against the crackdown on prescriptions said Reagan.
The state monitors the morphine milligram equivalent or MME a unit that compares the strength of opioids into the potency of morphine more than it watches the number of prescriptions.
Over the last four years the number of prescribed MMEs have dropped by two billion from 9.16 billion MMEs in 2012 to 7.83 MMEs in 2015. Theres been a decrease in every county according to health department data.
We believe we are lowering the amount that ends up in peoples medicine cabinets Reagan said.
Physician and prescriber education is essential in curbing the rate of prescription. Medical schools are beginning to focus more on pain treatment  its historically been a tiny component in the curriculum unless the student opts to become a pain specialist.
Opioid lobby spends big on Tennessee politics
Schools are beginning to incorporate more into programs and there are efforts to boost pain education offerings in the continuing education options for physicians said Reagan who described the existing offerings as very modest. Dr. David Edwards a pain specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center said the medical school is rethinking its pain curriculum there are other efforts taking shape around the state.
Opioid prescriptions are here to stay.
Pain treatment has to be individualized for each patient and opioids are often the best choice for getting people through surgery recovery experts said.
But there need to be more alternative treatments such as physical therapy easily accessed and have reasonable coverage in insurance plans Reagan and Edwards said. Generic opioids are cheaper than newer drugs or alternative therapies that may have limited coverage under someones insurance benefits.
Edwards is working with a patient who after being on opioids for about 10 years and being in her 80s to wean her off the prescription using first aquatherapy then regular physical in conjunction with other types of pain medications. He was concerned other side effects would negatively impact her health as she ages. Shes made good progress over the course of the year but is in limbo until 2017 when her physical therapy allotments reset he said.
Doctors also have to grapple with the expectations of the people sitting in the exam rooms which influence what they want out of a visit and what they accept as satisfactory treatment.
Patients have come to equate a successful visit with a page from the doctor's prescription pad whether it's an antibiotic to help a winter cold or a painkiller for a weekend injury said Natalie Tate vice president of pharmacy management at BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee.
People have expectations about living without pain which became known as the fifth vital sign in the 1990s.
Reagan said there is not enough talk about functionality and what it takes to ensure people can do what they need and want to in life.
There is the expectation or the hope that the pain will be gone so you dont have to think about that. Part of that is just human nature. Part of it is American society looking to medicine for a quick fix said Edwards. Pain doctors we dont necessarily cure any kind of pain. We think of it like diabetes. You have a problem or a disease that needs to be managed. If people dont want to harm their kidneys they manage their diabetes really closely. If you have chronic pain it may be there the rest of your life.

How experts would change the fight against opioid pervasiveness
Dr. David Edwards a pain specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center
I would say that take a little less pressure off the patients and put a little more onus on the prescribers. I would require the creation of educational tools for the alternatives to opioids. Every prescriber should be educated or re-educated on what the alternatives are in addition to safe prescribing guidelines and having the controlled substance monitoring database link to other states.
Dr. David Reagan chief medical officer of the Tennessee Department of Health
I honestly think the most important things are being able to destigmatize substance abuse disorders so we can talk about them openly and we dont ostracize people who are impacted by them. If we thought about it fundamentally like diabetes or cancer we wouldnt spend time moralizing over whether actions put people at risk.
Dr. Richard Soper an addiction specialist with Center for Behavioral Wellness in Nashville.
Having a regular forum for health care law enforcement media and community leaders every quarter or so would help increase an open dialogue and move toward an environment that doesnt punish people for coming to medical professionals for help. The state needs more in-patient beds to treat addiction.
Natalie Tate vice president of pharmacy management at BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee
It cant just be from a prescription management change for example that we may do here or it cant be us only talking with physicians. There needs to be an acute awareness that this is a public health crisis for us across the state and the long-term consequences  even though I dont know if we fully recognize the extent at this point. Its not really a policy but a public awareness that its critical for us to be successful.
Fentanyl is flooding the streets of downtown Nashville and business owners are saying they're seeing drug deals go down in broad daylight.
Metro health leaders say Tennessee ranks top five in the country for drug overdoses and Metro Nashville Health Department says we are in the deadliest phase of this narcotic epidemic with overdose deaths rapidly increasing.
City leaders called to have a meeting Tuesday to raise awareness about these issues affecting everyone not just drug users.
Tanja Jacobs lost her 22-year-old son in Nashville to a drug overdose.
It changes your life. Your life will never be the same Jacobs emphasized.
She said her son thought he was buying cocaine but it was laced with fentanyl.
They were lied to they were deceived what they asked for is not what they had gotten and thats why theyre gone Jacobs said.
Jacobs said her son did not have a substance use disorder and that he was recreationally using this drug.
The Metro Police undercover sergeant said Tuesday that no recreational drugs in Nashville are safe anymore.
He said they are finding fentanyl in all different types of drugs like cocaine Xanax Adderall and more.
FOX 17 News Kaitlin Miller asked I know theres a concern with tourism with all the drugs found on Broadway. Do you think this could really impact the reputation of this city
The sergeant responded Thats certainly something were trying to avoid. Our operations in the downtown corridor have been highly successful and they will continue to be highly successful.
Metro's Health Department says there were 336 overdose deaths in Davidson County in 2017 725 overdose deaths in 2021 and theyre expecting this number to be even higher for 2022.
The police sergeant said more needs to be done especially in the downtown corridor.
I personally would like to see the increased availability of Narcan or naloxone which is the drug that will reverse the effects of an opioid overdose the sergeant explained.
He said this is the number one issue they're trying to combat right now so hopefully other mothers won't have to go through the pain Jacobs did a few years ago.
City leaders say this need to be an all-hands-on-deck approach with local organizations law enforcement agencies schools and more.
They say its going to take the whole community to help raise awareness.

Tennessee families will soon receive state-funded assistance to battle addiction and keep children out of foster care.
On Monday the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse announced a 5-year 3 million program designed to help families and children affected by opioids and other substance abuse by addressing addiction improving permanency and enhancing the safety of children in affected households.
When addiction hits a person it impacts their whole family in ways that will be felt for years to come said Commissioner Marie Williams in a press release. Weve seen time and time again that if a person can achieve recovery they can unlock the door to being the parent they always wanted to be.
Tennessee is among the hardest-hit states by the opioid epidemic a crisis now known to have been aided by pharmaceutical companies misrepresenting the addictive nature of opioids during the 1990s and encouraging prescriptions. The over-prescription played a major role in widespread misuse and rural areas were particularly hard-hit.
In 2017 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared the U.S. Opioid Epidemic a public health emergency.
In Tennessee there were 2388 opioid overdose deaths in 2020 more than 4 million painkiller prescriptions in 2021 and 824 babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome in 2020 according to the Tennessee Department Health.
Because the opioid crisis has primarily affected rural counties Tennessee and its partners will be focusing on nine counties in Middle Tennessee Bedford Coffee Franklin Giles Hickman Lawrence Lincoln Marshall and Maury counties.
Families will be provided intensive in-home crisis intervention and life skills education to help them fight addiction and create better home lives for children.
Because the services are coming to them travel expenses and other barriers preventing families from receiving care should no longer be an issue said Matthew Parriot spokesman for the Department of Mental Health.
The desired outcome is to avoid out of home placement at the end of the day everyone wants the same thing to keep the family together because thats whats best for the kids he said.
The department is also partnering with the Tennessee Department of Childrens Services Department of Human Services the Administrative Office of the Courts and Centerstone a nonprofit organization providing crisis-intervention services.
Grant funding for the program runs through September 2027.
Tennessees mental health department runs a similar program called Therapeutic Intervention Education and Skills TIES to assist children up to 18 years old at risk of being placed in foster care due to their caregivers substance abuse.

Healthy Tennessee will hold a summit entitled Working Together to Solve the Opioid Crisis.
This summit is the first of its kind and will be focused on solutions collaboration and action.
Manny Sethi M.D. is president of Healthy Tennessee and is an orthopaedic trauma surgeon.
Tennessee has become a hot bed destination for tourism in recent years but unfortunately we have also become a haven for opioid abuse leading to a record number of deaths in the Volunteer State.
The numbers attributed to the opioid crisis are staggering. Just this week the Tennessee Department of Health reported that drug overdose deaths killed more Tennesseans than ever before a trend that has been repeated for six years in a row.
Tennessee has one of the highest opioid overdose death rates in the country. Three people die every day in Tennessee due to opioids  more than traffic-related fatalities.
The opioid crisis is not just a rural problem as 1-in-5 opioid overdose deaths in 2016 were right here in Davidson County. In fact deaths involving fentanyl an incredibly potent synthetic opioid are up 70 percent since last year. Fentanyl is sometimes found in counterfeits illegally smuggled in to our country and has now surpassed heroin now as the deadliest drug in Nashville.
The opioid crisis also has had an economic impact on our state as the University of Tennessee found that there is a direct correlation between opioid use unemployment and a decline in labor force participation.
Building a healthy Tennessee and fighting this opioid epidemic we face are directly linked. Almost a decade ago my wife Maya and I started Healthy Tennessee with the goal of improving health across Tennessee.
Harnessing the power of local communities and hundreds of volunteers we conducted health fairs in small towns and large cities across our great state. But one thing we quickly realized is that all too often organizations like Healthy Tennessee and others operate in silos where one hand does not know what the other is doing.
In other words our state has many important and effective community health organizations but we often tend to duplicate efforts as we dont collaborate or communicate.
Collaboration is key to breaking the silo
To try and break down these silos over the past two years we have partnered with the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee Health Foundation to bring over 150 organizations together in summits across Tennessee.
Through these efforts we developed a better sense of community and developed shared goals forging the path toward a powerful network of community health organizations across our state.
For example from these meetings came the concept of creating the first of its kind statewide list-serve to connect stakeholders from Memphis to Mountain City breaking down silos with one click.
Through our health fairs and summits across Tennessee we have seen firsthand the impact opioid addiction has had in every corner of our state. We have met with incredible organizations and individuals who are committed to solve the opioid crisis but face the same challenges I mention above  working in silos .
Across Tennessee when it comes to prevention treatment and rehabilitation of opioid addiction we are often at the cutting edge. But to ultimately end the opioid crisis it will take more than any single action and will require a collaborative effort from all stakeholders involved there is no magic bullet.
As we have done previously for community health organizations I felt Healthy Tennessee needed to take the next step to collaborate on a more granular level and have these committed individuals and organizations from across the state together under one roof to develop strategies and action plans to solve the opioid crisis in Tennessee once and for all.
First of its kind summit will address and create solutions
This week Healthy Tennessee will hold a summit entitled Working Together to Solve the Opioid Crisis. This summit is the first of its kind in our state and will be focused on solutions collaboration and action.
The summit will include faith leaders law enforcement elected officials the private sector and non-profit organizations who are working on the front lines to solve the opioid crisis.
We are bringing together these individuals and groups to collaborate and understand how they can work together to ultimately solve the opioid crisis in Tennessee and beyond.
The summit will also hear from candidates for statewide office  Congressman Marsha Blackburn former Governor Phil Bredesen former Nashville Mayor Karl Dean and businessman Bill Lee  to hear how they will collaborate with these individuals and organizations to solve this crisis if elected in November.
My hope is that this summit will be an important next step to break down silos open lines of communications across the state and renew a sense of collaboration to ensure that Tennessee becomes a leader in solving the opioid crisis.

Xylazine or tranq is a horse tranquilizer that's being mixed with street drugs the TBI said.

Example video title will go here for this video
KNOXVILLE Tenn.  Overdose deaths involving the drug tranq rose to a new high across East Tennessee for the first time the Knox County Regional Forensic Center said. Across the center's 21 counties 106 people who died of overdoses had tranq or Xylazine in their bodies  over the first nine months of this year.
Xylazine is legal for use by veterinarians as a tranquilizer for animals. The Drug Enforcement Agency said it's used as an adulterantwhich means it's mixed with other drugs like heroin or fentanyl to reduce the amount of money drug makers have to spend on a mixture and increase their profits.
Xylazine is sometimes called the Zombie Drug because it slows brain activity breathing and heart rates. Those who inject the drug are at risk of amputation thanks to disfiguring sores.
In Knox County Xylazine contributed to 67 drug-related deaths from Jan. 1 to Sept. 30. The county reported its first Xylazine-related death in 2018.
It's not just came in it's trying to take over said Chris Thomas the Knox County Regional Forensic Center Director.
The graph below shows how quickly tranq-related deaths grew across the Regional Forensic Center's 21 counties.
We're not talking about drugs. We're talking about poisons now said Tommy Farmer the Tennessee Dangerous Drugs Task Force Director. It's not a matter of 'Does my fentanyl have xylazine in it' It's a matter of 'Yes it does have Xylazine in it.'
Federal drug investigators also said Xylazine can prolong a user's high.
If there's something they can get their hands on that's cheap that can intensify the high or the effects or even stretch the amount of drugs Farmer said. Those are going to be ways that they can increase their profit margin.
NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  Its the epidemic you may have heard little about in 2020 but we now know drug overdoses claimed more than 93000 lives that year.
The Centers for Disease Control says this increase of nearly 30 percent from the year before is the highest number of deaths in twelve months. Its also the largest increase since 1999.
Trevor Henderson is the director of Metro Nashvilles Overdose Response Program. He says it wasnt long ago that 300 deaths across Davidson County were cause for alarm.
Last year alone that number more than doubled with 619 people who lost their lives to overdose in Davidson County. Henderson says its important to note that this number is not limited to residents of Davidson County. There are some cases where individuals are transported to the county from another hospital in the state and die.
Suspected Fatal Drug Overdoses
Nashville saw a 32 increase in fatal drug overdoses in 2020 compared to the year prior with 468 suspected drug overdose deaths in 2019 and 619 in 2020. So far this year there have been 360 fatal overdoses up 11 compared to the same time last year.
Last year 80 of overdose-related toxicology reports detected fentanyl.
In 2020 the highest number of deaths occurred in the following ZIP codes 37207 37115 37211 37013 37209
The ZIP codes with the largest increase in deaths compared to 2019 are 37209 up 167 37210 up 156 and 37217 up 83.
Nonfatal Drug Overdose-related Emergency Department Visits
Visits were up 30 in 2020 compared to 2019.
In 2019 more than half of these visits 57 involved heroin but in 2020 50 involved opioids without heroin and 45 involved heroin.
In 2020 the highest number of drug overdoses requiring EMS response occurred in the following ZIP codes 37115 37211 37013 37214
The ZIP codes with the largest increase in overdose incidents compared to 2019 are 37214 up 85 37076 up 57 and 37210 up 57.
Henderson says at this rate we could top 700 for the first time in the county and its an issue he says is only made worse because of fentanyl.
When you ask whats my concern. I think thats pretty obvious. This crisis has become much more deadly Henderson said.
The synthetic opioid can be found in virtually any drug and it doesnt help that its one of the deadliest when abused. Henderson says for Tennessee to make any progress we have to think of this as a public health crisis.
Its like a lot of other chronic health care conditions. A system of care needs to be built. We have a lot of the pieces but its not a system that is seamless just yet Henderson said.
Henderson says ideally we should see Narcan kits offered to overdose survivors as they leave the hospital. That way they have a life-saving tool already available. He says work is already underway to make this a reality at local emergency rooms.
Tennessee has not released its numbers for 2020 overdose deaths but the CDC already predicts an increase of more than 40 percent from 2019. Only nine other states had predictions that high according to their data. In 2019 Tennessee had 2089 overdose deaths. None of these numbers surprise Tanja Jacobs.
It just shows that this is worse than most people think Jacobs said.
Her son Romello Marchman died of an overdose in 2020 but Jacobs calls it fentanyl poisoning. Her son ingested what he thought was cocaine only for a medical examiner to discover it was laced with fentanyl. She says no one intends on taking this highly potent drug so its poisoning at the very least. Murder at it's most extreme.
All you can do is tell people how dangerous it is and for people not to get complacent and think that their kids dont do it Jacobs said.
Through the Romello Marchman Foundation Jacobs has advocated for distributing fentanyl test strips as a life-saving measure. These strips have proven to help detect some trace amounts of fentanyl in most drugs. Jacobs says shes coordinating with national distributors to bring more of these strips to Davidson County.
Under current Tennessee law fentanyl test strips could be considered drug paraphernalia. Henderson says his office is working with Davidson County DA Glenn Funks office to decriminalize the distribution of these strips.
Jacobs understands these may be long-term solutions but she says we can begin with a public service announcement just as we did with COVID-19. With the number of overdose deaths continuing to rise she says it only makes sense to share whats at stake if we cant find a solution.
Were looking at shocking numbers now. Were projecting more shocking numbers for this year. Next year who knows where well be Henderson said.

Four days after Greg Witthauer went missing his parents got a phone call from a Metro Nashville Police Department chaplain.
Witthauer's body had been found.
His father Mark Witthauer had planned his son's funeral dozens of times in his mind during his 10-year addiction that ended with heroin and prescription painkillers. But he still wasn't ready for that call.
Mark Witthauer and his wife Karen were grateful that at the very least they could identify their son by describing his tattoos over the phone without having to see his body which was discovered in the passenger seat of his car parked near Percy Priest Lake. Police believe his body was moved from another location.
He was 23.
An only child Greg Witthauer grew up in a quiet neighborhood in Franklin playing soccer on a travel team and skateboarding in his spare time.
But Tennessee's wealthiest county isn't immune to the devastation of the ongoing opioid crisis. Twenty-seven people in Williamson County died in 2017 from overdoses including from drugs such as fentanyl and heroin.
From 2012 to 2016 there have been 10.3 drug overdose deaths per 100000 people in Williamson County according to data from the Sycamore Institute a nonpartisan public policy research center.
That's about one person every 17 days.
Greg Witthauer's addiction started when he was a teenager. And no matter where he went to school  he transferred from Centennial to Brentwood High to Middle College now known as Renaissance High  he could always find drugs his parents said.
The Witthauers' story contains chapters relatable to many families with loved ones in active addiction A home that feels more like a war zone. Valuables that go missing. Hidden syringes and needles.
In the 10 years Greg Witthauer used drugs he went to rehab nine times beginning at 15.
He started smoking marijuana as a high school freshman then moved up to benzodiazepines typically prescribed for anxiety then to cocaine then to prescription painkillers.
He was always looking for something to make him feel normal his mother said.
When compared to the rest of Tennessee it can look like Williamson County hasn't been touched by the opioid epidemic.
Out of 1186 opioid overdose deaths in Tennessee in 2016 Williamson County had 26. Davidson County had 248.
But families who have lost their children and loved ones in Williamson County tell a different story.
'They still don't think it's affecting them'
More than 200 people attended a forum at Our Savior Lutheran Church earlier this month organized by the Witthauers and Liz and Yarnell Beatty a Brentwood couple who lost their son Alex to an overdose in 2016.
The forum Breaking the Silence featured addiction and recovery professionals including Dr. Stephen Loyd the former medical director for Tennessee's substance abuse services division. Loyd resigned from that position in February to accept the role of co-medical director at JourneyPure at the River a private drug rehab center in Murfreesboro.
Loyd said the single largest problem with addressing addiction isn't a lack of money resources or access to treatment.
It's the social stigma he said that keeps people from seeking treatment and families from getting the support they need when a loved one is struggling with addiction.
Loyd likens it to the stigma borne out of the HIV and AIDS epidemic in the 1980s when that diagnosis was considered a death sentence.
Addiction particularly the opioid epidemic is this generation's HIV and AIDS epidemic Loyd said. You can have all the resources in the world but if you don't have people ready to step out and ask for help it doesn't matter.
Tricia Benitez a treatment specialist with Addiction Campuses is often the first point of contact for people who decide to enter recovery.
She visits Williamson Medical Center regularly to touch base with staffers who treat overdose patients. But those employees say some patients deny having a problem even after an overdose Benitez said.
They say these people still don't think they have a problem. They still don't think it's affecting them because of their status quo location Benitez said. We're trying to make sure they understand the devastation of what's happening in our own backyard. If we continuously just brush it under the rug ... nothing's going to get done.
Williamson Medical Center declined to comment for this story.
'Things are getting deadlier quicker'
Dean Porterfield is the director of adolescent programs at Cumberland Heights in Nashville a nonprofit alcohol and drug addiction recovery center. He also runs a counseling practice.
The main demographic Porterfield serves are young white men usually from affluent families.
The one thing these adolescents are searching for is purpose  a place to belong. A lot of times with that lifestyle of comfort and ease you've also taken away that young person's purpose to fit in he said.
While dismissing teens' drug use as just a phase may have worked in the past Porterfield said the emergence of deadly drugs such as fentanyl can be fatal for people experimenting with drugs.
Some kids experiment but I think now ... that's kind of gone away because things are getting deadlier quicker he said.
While parents want the best for their children Porterfield said raising kids in affluent homes with little responsibility can sometimes backfire especially if they're not held accountable for their actions.
These families have the means to kind of bail their kids out frequently. The more you bail them out the more it reinforces their behavior because they don't suffer the consequences. That tends to escalate.
But treatment doesn't look the same for someone with a full-blown addiction as it does for someone dabbling with certain drugs he said. Treatment can range from inpatient and sober living facilities to intensive outpatient care or counseling.
It's hard to say what rock bottom is for a lot of these kids because that could be death he said. All I ask kids to do is to admit they abuse substances  that's easier for them to wrap their head around. Not all these kids will go out and have a full-blown addiction.
Cumberland Heights has two outpatient centers in Williamson County  one that recently opened in Spring Hill that treats adults and an adolescent outpatient program in Cool Springs.
When looking at treating kids its important that we treat the whole family and make them part of the process Porterfield said.
More resources needed
At one point Greg Witthauer had 20 months of sobriety. He was on probation related to theft charges and was participating in the 21st District Recovery Court in Williamson County.
After injuring his back at work Greg Witthauer saw a doctor in Nashville and told him he was an addict and in drug court.
The doctor prescribed him painkillers anyway the Witthauers said. Then he relapsed.
The doctor gave him 10 pills and that was all it took Karen Witthauer said through tears. He would say 'Mom every day it just eats at me.' 
Jeff Long worked as an assistant district attorney in the 21st Judicial District before he was first elected as Williamson County sheriff in 2008. He's familiar with the migration of the state's opioid crisis which started with prescription painkillers then heroin in East Tennessee and worked its way west.
The 21st Recovery Court is one option for some nonviolent offenders charged with a felony in Williamson County. The two-year court-supervised recovery program offers alternative sentencing for people whose offenses are a result of illegal drug use.
Long said the Recovery Court is a valuable asset for Williamson County's court system but added that treating underlying mental health issues in defendants is equally important.
We're trying to develop a program where both the mental health aspects and drug addiction is treated at the same time Long said. You can't treat one without the other.
Recovery Court Director Connie Martin said the program has roughly 30 participants at any given time and about 20 more who may be in long-term inpatient treatment.
Participants must follow strict requirements such as maintaining employment attending monthly court dates and taking a drug test three times a week. About 50 percent don't complete the program Martin said.
While the program accepts people from Williamson Hickman Lewis and Perry counties roughly 70 percent of its participants are from Williamson County.
Recovery Court also helps participants find housing and food through partnerships with other local nonprofits and provides medical and psychiatric care through third parties  all on an annual budget around 400000 Martin said.
You'd think from one of the most affluent counties in the state resources would be plentiful here but they're not she said.
Our dream is to one day have a residential facility like DC4 she said referring to the Davidson County Drug Court Residential Program which has its own inpatient treatment facility. Martin knows it's a lofty goal but said she won't give up as long as she's the Recovery Court director.
Addiction in Williamson County By the numbers
Williamson County had 26 drug overdose deaths in 2016.
In 2015 the county had 265 nonfatal overdose outpatient visits and 116 nonfatal overdose inpatient stays.
More than 42500 people received opioids for pain in the county last year down slightly from 44800 people in 2016.
Nearly 121000 opioid prescriptions were filled in the county last year.
The three opioids most commonly prescribed in the county last year were short-acting hydrocodone short-acting oxycodone and short-acting Tramadol.
Between 2013 and 2017 the number of prescriptions filled in the county for short-acting Tramadol increased more than 15 percent.

He took life for granted.
And then his lifestyle was taken away.
Now Stephen Staley 24 is being held behind bars for drug and other offenses. He wrote me a letter from his current home DC-4 in Davidson County Drug Court to express his regret and to publicly declare he is a changed man.
March 9 he wrote marked the day he had been clean of all my substance abuse for one year.
Staley said he wrote to me after reading the column I wrote about Christine French Cully the editor of Highlights magazine. Her late husband's motto was It's a great day to be alive.
That line caught his eye. So he penned me a letter.
Last week's columnKelly Clarkson gives Nashville teacher 10K for Ukranian refugees after story appeared in this column  The Type Set
I wrote him back about my own father who was in his earlier life a heroin addict who did time in a federal institution. My father who died in 2013 did his best to shake the demons that had haunted him as a young man. It was a struggle for him.
I hope Staley understood my message There is always a chance to turn your life around.
Maybe the saddest thing Staley wrote was that he felt given up on ... not just by loved ones and friends but God and society as a whole. He went on I've been viewed as a villain for so long.
One's world view doesn't get much darker than those two sentences.
Staley grew up in Cleveland Tennessee.
At 12 years old Staley saw his father smoking methamphetamine and instead of being horrified he thought it was the coolest thing. He didn't start using then but he filed his curiosity away.
It would come back later with a vengeance.
He said he started using alcohol and marijuana at 16. Drug use was followed by shoplifting. He was caught trying to steal an auxiliary cord for his car stereo from Walmart.
At 18 Staley tried amphetamines. And soon found himself surrounded by people who were hooked.
At 19 he was arrested for driving under the influence. And it wasn't long before his old curiosity caught up with him. He tried meth. Within seven months he was an intravenous meth user.
One low point Staley will never forget is when he stole his mother's wedding ring and let her think the she had lost it.
Criminal charges piled up Theft possession drug manufacture resale delivery. He was facing 18 years in prison when he was given a second chance. The court allowed him to try to get clean in a drug rehabilitation facility in Arizona.
I thought I had my addiction beat he wrote. I thought because I had God on my side I couldn't fail.
More importantly I thought I could still have one drink.
One drink turned into a needle in his arm. Thirteen months of rehab was gone in an instant.
It was during this time while he was blowing his second chance that he met a woman named Denise. She was not a user.
For some reason she wanted to help me he wrote. Til this day I don't understand why.
On March 9 2021 Staley was arrested again for theft.
He contemplated suicide. I was ready to end it he wrote. It seemed like an easier option. No one would miss or even recognize me gone.
He was given a second second chance  18 to 24 months in DC-4 in Nashville.
Uplifting storyThe tragic reason this Middle Tennessee couple leaves huge tips at area restaurants  The Type Set
Most importantly Denise promised she would hold his hand wherever he went. And maybe that promise is what saved him. His mother has also been there to support him as he tries to stay sober.
Staley is approaching the halfway mark of his sentence and Staley wrote he is the happiest I've been in 20 years. He will start a work-experience program and then live in a halfway house.
I hit my rock bottom and I'm climbing slowly back to the top he wrote.
Staley is in a 12-step program. As he wrote to me he was in his third step which involved turning his life over to a higher power.
Staley is dreaming about the day he is free. He dreams about being a good man for Denise and her three boys. He dreams of reconnecting with family and friends.
In February Staley revealed to his mother that he had stole her wedding ring.
A weight lifted off my shoulders he wrote. She forgave me.
Staley has another very specific dream. When he is free he was to operate a food truck called Uncle Bud's featuring bakery goods.
I will succeed he wrote. One day at a time.

NASHVILLE NC WTVD -- The Nash County Sheriff's Office seized 173000 worth of heroin Sunday one of the largest heroin busts in the county's history.
Investigators say heroin is an epidemic.
It's affecting every community in our area Sheriff Keith Stone said. His officers took down the supplier through its Tar River Regional Taskforce a group of law enforcement agencies throughout eastern North Carolina.
Authorities arrested Billy Ray Johnson of Nashville during a traffic stop off I-95 in Halifax County after receiving a tip that he was trafficking heroin.
Stone said the powdery substance is destroying families every day in his community.
He said four people overdosed just last week.
Billy Ray Johnson is being held on a 500000 bond. Nash County Sheriff's Office
The mother and the daughter were doing heroin. The daughter overdoses. Her son actually overdosed and died in January. I see people leaving their families over this Stone said.
According to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services there have been more than 250 heroin deaths statewide.
Investigators said the drug is popular because it's cheap - costing roughly around 8.
RELATED Heroin causing havoc in Nash County
Stone said the drug is smuggled across the border and then trafficked into the community by local suppliers.
Johnson is facing felony drug-trafficking charges. He's being held on a 500000 bond.
Investigators hope this is a wake-up call to the community.
If you sell heroin you are committing murder and we will do everything we can to catch you Stone said.
In Nash County the Hope Initiative formed in February. The program allows people to go to Nashville police to turn in drugs or ask for help to get clean -- without any penalty.
So far six people have asked for help. Read more about the program here.

The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services TDMHSAS state and local government partners dozens of substance use prevention coalitions and law enforcement agencies are teaming up for National Prescription Drug Take Back Day this Saturday April 27th 2024.
There are more than 110 locally organized events across Tennessee with most scheduled for 1000am to 200pm local time.
Find a Take Back Day Event near you using this Interactive Map
Take Back Day is an opportunity for anyone to safely and securely dispose of medications in their home that are either expired or no longer needed. In 2023 Tennesseans disposed of nearly 13000 pounds of medications across the two Take Back Days in April and October.
Chances are good you have prescription medications that you dont need anymore. Disposal is easy and fast at one of our Take Back Day events. With prescription opioids and other medications theres risk of misuse and potential addiction. By getting them out of your house you might prevent years of heartache or even save a life said TDMHSAS Commissioner Marie Williams LCSW.
Safe and secure disposal of prescription drugs protects public health and Tennessees waterways said David Salyers commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. The National Prescription Drug Take Back Day helps raise awareness about this important issue and TDEC is proud to be a part of it.
For people unable to stop by a Take Back Day event there are 379 permanent drug drop boxes located across the state with at least one in each of Tennessees 95 counties. In 2023 Tennesseans safely and securely disposed of more than 57 tons of medications through the permanent drug drop boxes.

Epidemic brings higher medical jail costs and deflates work productivity
'Substance use disorder is killing our future'
Substance abuse annually costs Tennessee more than 2 billion  more than half of which is attributed to lost income from people who have fallen out of the labor market according to an economist.
The substance abuse epidemic  most notably involving opioids  raises questions about access to treatment how to stem the illicit use of prescription painkillers and staunch the use of illegal drugs.
MoreInvestigation How many lives are lost to opioids No one knows.
But the economic impact is less understood and not generally a component of policy discussions.
Teresa Waters chair of preventive medicine at University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center who leads a policy research group dug into the costs associated with substance abuse.
The 2 billion cost to Tennessee includes
46 million for babies born in the state with neonatal abstinence syndrome
422.5 million for hospitalizations associated with opioid abuse and
138 million for hospitalizations with alcohol listed as the first diagnosis.
But at 1.29 billion the lost income from having an estimated 31000 people or 1 percent of the workforce out of jobs is the biggest component.
Waters expected the economic impact to be sizable but was still surprised by the final tally  especially given the decision to take a conservative approach to the analysis.
When I put it all together I was like 'wow.' It's striking. It's a wake-up call that this is not just a sad story. This is an economic story said Waters.
Epidemic brings higher medical jail costs and deflates work productivity
Waters started her analysis after talking with Dr. David Stern vice-chancellor for clinical affairs for the University of Tennessees College of Medicine and the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center.
MoreOpioid epidemic 'getting worse instead of better' public health officials warn
Stern wants to create a program for new physicians to be trained in addiction medicine and wanted to put the cost of his proposal in context with what abuse costs the state.
Waters said she took a conservative approach to the analysis so the overall economic impact and state spending is likely higher. In fact she didn't include costs associated with substance abuse overdoses because of debate over how to estimate economic impact from early loss of life.
I dont think this is completely comprehensive. Its really the most obvious areas said Waters.
Nationally the opioid epidemic cost the U.S. economy more than 504 billion in 2015 the White Houses Council of Economic Advisers projected in a November study.
In most states there is a dearth of qualified physicians with training in addiction medicine  and there are expensive ramifications said John Donahue CEO of Axial Healthcare a start-up in Nashville that works with insurers to identify over-prescription and people at risk for addiction.
Patients that Axial has identified as high risk for opioid abuse use 300 percent more health care services than patients who are not seeking opioids Donahue said. The spending comes down when people get into treatment.
Waters spends a lot of her time looking at health care financing and the cost effectiveness of medical treatment. She'll be leaving Memphis soon to be the chair of the department of health management at policy at University of Kentucky College of Public Health.
The disconnect between treatments for physical and mental health is an impediment to getting people help said Waters.
She wants people to understand the nexus between health and economy  the costs it brings to the state.
In a separate analysis Waters estimates that the state spends 273 million annually on effects drug and alcohol-related health problems and crimes. When combined with lost sales tax revenue the cost is 513 million to the state budget.
TennCare spent 41.4 million on incremental costs related to babies born with NAS according to a 2017 report  a figure that's been on the rise over the last several years.
Hospitalizations associated with opioid abuse cost TennCare 76.9 million per 2015 data.
Adult incarceration for drug and alcohol related offenses cost nearly 123 million in 2015.
'Substance use disorder is killing our future'
With 1 percent of the workforce out of work due to substance abuse the state loses out on 239.4 million in annual sales tax revenue.
And Waters thinks there are probably more people out of work because of substance abuse or at least working at lower levels of productivity.
Having people in the prime of work years ages 20s through their 40s out of work brings long-term consequences for the state and families.
These folks are losing their education losing their ability to work productively said Waters. That's a huge huge loss.
Waters hopes the economic impact of the epidemic drives more state lawmakers to think of the issue as more than tragedy for families but as a roadblock to a healthy state in the coming years.
It's really our future. Substance use disorder is killing our future. We want to bring in more jobs to Tennessee. We want to have a stronger workforce said Waters. If we want to attract Amazon these big companies we have to have a strong workforce.

What are opioids and how can they destroy a body
Two and a half billion pain pills. That's how many opioids were supplied to Tennessee over six years according to data recently released by The Washington Post.
The data from the Drug Enforcement Administration shows the top distributors manufacturers and pharmacies for pain pills across the nation  a glimpse into the legal but opaque world of opioid prescriptions.
One out of every three opioid overdose deaths nationwide involved prescription pain pills in 2017 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
As the nation's opioid epidemic surged so did the pills climbing nearly 51 percent in the six-year period covered by the database from 2006 to 2012. The data revealed that towns struggling with addiction were the ones with the most pills pumped into them.
The Post and HD Media which publishes the Charleston Gazette-Mail in West Virginia sued for access to the database. Government regulators and the drug industry fought to prevent its release. The now publicly-available data is limited to hydrocodone and oxycodone.
In Tennessee Walgreens was the top distributor of pain pills pushing out half a billion in six years. The leading pharmacy was Reeves-Sain Extended Care in Murfreesboro co-owned by state Sen. Shane Reeves.
Reeves-Sain Extended Care provided prescriptions to long-term care and hospice facilities. Typically long-term care pharmacies pre-package medication for nursing homes assisted living and similar health care providers.
We provided a great deal of medication based on the needs of chronic conditions and end-of-life care said Amanda Cecconi a spokeswoman for TwelveStone Health Partners which is the current name for Reeves' business. Reeves-Sain was one of the largest providers to those organizations in this state and across 10 others.
In spite of the opioid issue in our state we cant punish patients who are dying from cancer COPD heart failure and other conditions who are in significant pain.
Reeves who has served as a senator since 2018 worked as a pharmacist in Murfreesboro for 25 years. The retail portion of Reeves-Sain pharmacy sold in 2015 to Fred's Inc. It has since closed.
The extended care component was spun off and is now operated under the name TwelveStone Health Partners. Reeves is the company's CEO.

Nationwide drug manufacturers were hit with lawsuits alleging their responsibility in the surge of addiction.
McKesson faced a 2007 case brought by the DEA that alleged the company was shipping millions of hydrocodone to internet pharmacies despite being instructed to report suspicious orders. The distributor paid 13.25 million to settle the case. It has since reached settlements for 150 million and 37 million over similar allegations.

Two people have been charged in connection with the drug overdose death of a 23-month-old child after a year-long investigation by Metro Nashville police.
Jesse Mashburn 36 and Melissa Sutton 46 were indicted by a grand jury after investigators said the toddler they were caring for Ariel Rose died of fentanyl ingestion on Nov. 11 2022 inside the Highroad Transitional Living Facility on 25th Avenue North.
The toddler had previously been living in the Brookmeade homeless encampment before her death according to other media reports.
Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid about 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times more potent than heroin.
Mashburn and Sutton were arrested Wednesday in a Hermitage apartment complex. Both are being held on 100000 bond.
Rose's grandfather Mickey Rose is suing Highroad Transitional Living Facility and Sutton as Ariel's babysitter saying both had obligations to keep the toddler away from drugs. He's seeking at least 15 million in damages court records show.
These places are supposed to help turn people's lives around Rose's attorney Isaac Kimes said in July. And very clearly as delineated in the lawsuit there were drugs running through this place like a river. And police were called out there I mean what we found in 2022 from January 1 until the day Ariel was found dead it was well over 100 times.
The lawsuit noted that Ariel was in the custody of her aunt but the woman had placed her in the care of her father Jonathan Rose who was living at the facility.
On the day of Ariel's death Jonathan Rose asked Sutton to watch the child the lawsuit said claiming that Sutton was a frequent user of illegal drugs. It claims the child came into contact with fentanyl in Sutton's room at some point.

Tennessees counties received 31.4 million from the states opioid abatement council in the first round of payments set to occur yearly over the next two decades.
The money comes as Tennessee ranked No. 2 in drug overdose deaths in 2021 based on population with an estimated 3813 people dying according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.
Lawmakers set up an abatement council to distribute what could be nearly 1 billion in settlement funds from opioid manufacturers and distributors to address Tennessees overdose crisis in part caused by them.
The states first round of money comes from a 600 million pot paid over 18 years by AmerisourceBergen Cardinal Health McKesson and Johnson  Johnson. Tennessee could also have access to another 490 million if proposed settlements with Allergan CVS Teva Walgreens and Walmart go through.
State law requires that 35 of the settlement fund are directly given to counties with the other 65 set aside for grant programs.
As part of the county funds the state set up a distribution formula for giving the money out based on the impact of the opioid crisis in each community.
Across the United States drug manufacturers and distributors have agreed to nearly 50 billion in settlement payments related to their role in causing the opioid crisis.
KFF News a nonprofit health news publication created a database to track the professionals deciding how the money would be spent.
The councils makeup could play a critical role in whether money is spent on prevention and harm-reducing programs versus policing activities.
KFF found that Tennessees council has a higher percentage of law enforcement and criminal justice officials on the council than in other states.
But some restrictions are already in place for how counties can spend their settlement money. They have a list of 12 programs they can choose from.
The abatement council  created in 2021  is a 13-member body with appointments by the governor Senate speaker House Speaker the Tennessee County Services Associations and the state municipal league.
Overdose deaths in Tennessee jumped nearly 50 in 2020 according to new data from the Tennessee Department of Health. Close to 80 of overdose deaths were caused by synthetic and prescription opioids.
Tennesseans living with addiction point to two major factors in the spike in overdose deaths support systems interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the increased presence of fentanyl a highly potent synthetic opioid. These numbers put Tennessee on the leading edge of a rapidly progressing overdose crisis that claimed nearly 100000 lives in the United States in 2020.
COVID-19 restrictions and precautions have threatened some of the most relied-upon tools for managing addiction regular in-person meetings peer-to-peer support and the sense of connectedness that comes with a recovery community.
Nathan Payne lives in Cookeville Tennessee where he works for the Lifeline Peer Project a state-funded program staffed by individuals with personal experience managing addiction and recovery. When COVID first hit it was devastating to the whole recovery community not just to the new people remembers Payne. There were people with multiple years who are still not able to find their way back.
Healthcare workers and individuals managing substance abuse note that addiction thrives on loneliness. Payne compared individuals managing addiction with canaries in the coal mine highly sensitive to the larger trends in mental health exacerbated by a year of isolation. Per state prevalence data 436000 Tennesseans are living with a substance abuse disorder of some kind.
Part of maintaining recovery for folks who have struggled with addiction is that youve built up support around yourself said Amie Little a Peer Recovery Case Manager at the Sullivan County Anti-Drug Coalition in Bristol Tennessee an area of the state often overrepresented in opioid use and overdose data. Some people need a lot of structure rituals to go to meetingsa lot of support that people build around themselves. When COVID happened it wrecked a lot of them.
As rehabilitation centers and outreach programs have integrated COVID-19 safety precautions or deal with outbreaks typical rhythms for accepting referrals have become less predictable and less reliable. Timeliness predictability and reliability are crucial to addiction healthcare.
When someones ready to go to treatment you got to catch them right then. That clarity comes and goes. Working with folks in the jail we try to have them a bed and treatment for when theyre released said Little who works specifically with individuals returning from incarceration. COVID-19 policies and protocolsrequiring time for testing and quarantininghave extended and interrupted time-sensitive pathways to recovery. Ive had several clients die coming out of incarceration this year. Individuals returning from incarceration are far more likely than the general population to die of overdoses.
According to Little the continued criminalization of drug use has also contributed to the overdose crisis particularly as it relates to fentanyl. Of the 3032 overdose deaths that occurred last year 66 involved fentanyl. That is up from 18 in 2016 according to the most recent data from the Tennessee Department of Health.
Those who work closely in addiction healthcare like Payne and Little are aware of the increased presence of fentanylbad batches in Paynes words. Fentanyl is a highly potent synthetic opioid that can trigger an overdose in very small quantities. Its presence in methamphetamines cocaine and heroin can be a deliberate attempt to heighten narcotic effects or the accidental result of cross contamination.
Marie Williams Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services has overseen the States response to the opioid crisis since 2016.
We had a plan to deal with opioid abuse said Williams over the phone in late August. However as those came down street drugs laced with fentanyl came up. The reason were seeing a lot of overdoses right now is not what we were seeing five or eight years ago around the pill overdose its more the street drugs were seeing laced with fentanyl.
If fentanyl is present in a substance individuals often dont know beforehand and could face serious legal penalties for trying to find out. Test strips that allow users to determine the presence of fentanyl in street drugs are explicitly classified as drug paraphernalia under Tennessee law and carry potential felony charges. As jurisdictions around the country change punitive drug-testing laws Tennesseans still cant test street drugs for fentanyl without risking legal consequences.
There's been isolation with COVID yes but this population is historically cut off from community. People with substance abuse disorder - the person of low socioeconomic status who's smoking meth especially with criminal justice involvement are seen as drug addicts. Not community members. Making space for those people bringing them in enfranchising them giving them their community and standin back . . . that works.  Amie LIttle Sullivan County Anti-Drug Coalition
When overdoses do happen they do not have to be fatal. Naloxone also known by its brand name Narcan is an effective way to reverse an overdose if administered quickly. Since 2018 the State of Tennessee has distributed over 200000 Naloxone units that have been used to prevent an estimated 27000 overdose deaths per an internal report from August 2021. Narcan is effective but not always available and requires training for proper use. It can be found locally across Tennessee at the sites listed here.
If Narcan is not immediately on hand calling 911 for emergency medical assistance while witnessing an overdose could come with a second degree murder charge. Tennessees Death by Distribution law which went into effect in 2018 incriminates those involved in giving or selling someone drugs laced with fentanyl if that person fatally overdoses. The law was amended in 2019 to allow the state to pursue capital punishment.
Alongside its punitive laws Tennessees response to the opioid epidemic includes a vast network of intervention initiatives recovery resources and addiction healthcare workers like Nathan Payne. The Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services oversees an addiction services hotline 1-800-889-9789 administers Narcan and Narcan training and employs and supports peer recovery specialists statewide. Its 498-million-dollar budget is likely to swell in the coming years as attorneys general close in on billion-dollar settlements with opioid manufacturers and distributors.
Little who works independently from the State of Tennessee but for an employer that receives state funding emphasizes that it will take more than money to effectively address the forces that drive addiction jeopardize recovery and lead to more drug overdoses.
Theres been isolation with COVID yes but this population is historically cut off from community. People with substance abuse disorderthe person of low socioeconomic status whos smoking meth especially with criminal justice involvement are seen as drug addicts. Not community members said Little. Making space for those people bringing them in enfranchising them giving them their community and standing back and making a path forward for them. That works.
A recent study by Forbes Advisor determined that Tennessee is among the states with the least healthy populations in the country.
The study was based on rates of chronic diseases drug abuse and unhealthy lifestyle habits.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention six in 10 adults in the United States suffer from one chronic disease with four in 10 adults suffering from two. The key lifestyle risks for chronic disease include tobacco use poor nutrition lack of physical activity and excessive alcohol use said the CDC.
The CDC defines chronic diseases as conditions that last one year or more and require ongoing medical attention or limit activities of daily living or both. For example heart disease cancer or diabetes.
Eight of the 10 least healthy states are Southern states West Virginia Mississippi Tennessee Arkansas Kentucky Alabama Louisiana and Oklahoma.

Tennessee ranks fourth-worst in the lifestyle habits health outlook and the substance abuse category. Tennessee has the highest rate of opioid misuse 3743.97 per 100000 adults and prescription pain reliever misuse 3190.88 per 100000 adults in the country indicating a major opioid epidemic.
According to Vanderbilt University Medical Center at least three people die everyday in Tennessee from an opioid-related overdose more than the number of daily traffic fatalities. Additionally more opioid prescriptions are written each year than there are people living in Tennessee with more than 1 million prescriptions left over.
Tennessee is among the top 15 states in drug overdose deaths.

Given the Republican Party is so full of conspiracists and crackpots these days its understandable Tennessees federally elected GOP characters get short shrift from the media.
Competition is tough from U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia who doesnt know the difference between the Nazi Germany police force and cold tomato soup. A year ago U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas left his constituents to freeze when a 2021 ice storm took down the states power grid heading to Mexico to escape the chill at a luxury resort before being shamed home.
Kentucky U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie revealed in 2019 he didnt understand that political science is a liberal arts course during a clash with former Secretary of State John Kerry. Massie has since made more news after starting a holiday trend posing with his entire family holding weapons for his 2020 Christmas card.
I could go on for I havent even begun to write about the federal lawmakers propping up the Trump-led Jan. 6 insurrection and continued effort to overturn the 2020 election cc U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri but I write to call attention to Tennessees GOP ranks.
We havent written about senior U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn in a good while but her actions of late beg to be addressed.
To paraphrase a reporter from another outlet she doesnt get the media coverage that some of the other GOP standouts get but she says things that are way out there.
Over the last two weeks Blackburn held up congressional negotiations over a federal funding package a move that almost led to a government shutdown over an initiative by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration within the Health and Human Services Department to provide funds for organizations that distribute harm reduction kits to drug users.
The kits are aimed at reducing the spread of disease among users and include items like test strips for fentanyla synthetic opioid responsible for rising overdose cases both nationally and in Tennesseelock boxes for medication safe sex kits Federal Drug Administration-approved overdose reversal medication and syringes.
Blackburn or her staff members could have done a bit of research I googled harm reduction strategies in Europe to find out how similar strategies combined with decriminalization of small amounts of illicit drugs and a focus on the treatment of substance abuse has radically reduced overdoses in Portugal. When the U.S. had about 72000 drug overdose deaths in 2019 Portugal had less than 100.
Blackburn or a member of her staff could have researched harm reduction strategies but she chose to hold up the federal budget over false claims crack pipes would be distributed to substance abusers ignoring her own role in Americas opioid crisis.
But no. Instead Blackburn read conservative outlets like the Washington Free Beacon which published a story on Feb. 7 saying the Biden administration planned on buying crack pipes. Despite the story being debunked it remains at the top of the site.
The same day Blackburn posted a video tweet saying the Biden administration is busy filling vending machines with crack pipes.
What non-Tennessee outlets missed however is the rich irony of Blackburn complaining about funds used to help alleviate the opioid epidemic.
Since Blackburn first ran for Congress in 2002 she has taken more than 1 million in contributions from pharmaceutical companies or health PACs many associated with the same companies making opioid painkillers or distributing them across rural America.
As a congresswoman in 2014 she co-sponsored the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act. Thats a nice name for a bill that was written by a pharmaceutical industry lobbyist and one that significantly hinders the governments ability to halt suspicious shipments of narcotics.
A 2017 investigation by CBS News and the Washington Post into how the bill became law named Blackburn as a key backer of the legislation. Later she said the law may have had unintended consequences but an official with the Drug Enforcement Agency said he had briefed her in 2016 on how the law would worsen the opioid crisis.
Such hypocrisy coming from Blackburn holding up government funding over her moral outrage that Americans with substance abuse issues might get help while ignoring her own role in the continued opioid crisis.Tennesseans continue to die at alarming rates from opioid overdoses. According to reports from the Tennessee Department of Health 1451 Tennesseans died of overdoses in 2015 prior to the Blackburn-sponsored bill becoming law.
By 2020 the number had doubled with 3020 Tennesseans dying of drug overdoses. Overdoses from fentanyl increased by 50 according to health department statistics.
Given Blackburns willingness to play partisan politics chase red herrings and deny help to those in desperate need some days even Ted Cruz looks good.
In mid-October a 29-year-old man was overdosing. His friends rushed him to an Ashland City emergency room.
He survived and he was released that night after receiving treatment.
Cheatham County Sheriffs Lt. Shannon Heflin said the man and two other people had purchased drugs from Haley Smith 26 of Ashland City and the victim thought he was snorting cocaine which ended up being a combination of heroin and fentanyl.
In a new twist for criminal justice in Tennessee Smith now faces charges of attempted second-degree murder possessing schedule I drugs and possession of drug paraphernalia in connection to the near-fatal overdose.
Just over a month later the Cheatham County Sheriffs Office reported four overdoses in one weekend one of which was fatal.
Evidence related to that overdose the death of a 30-year-old Chapmansboro man led the Cheatham County Sheriffs Office to Christopher Stefko 39 on Nov. 25.
Investigators believe Stefko traveled from Nashville to Cheatham County to sell drugs to the victim. Undercover investigators arranged another heroin deal then arrested Stefko and took him to the Cheatham County Jail.
In addition to drug charges Stefko has been charged with second-degree murder.
Holding dealers accountable
Murder charges against alleged drug dealers in fatal or near-fatal drug overdoses has become increasingly common in recent years in Tennessee where opioid deaths increased 12 percent in 2016.
The Drug Policy Alliance points out that other states including Delaware Kansas and Wyoming among others also have drug-induced homicide laws.
They need to know if you sell something and somebody dies you can be held accountable Metro Nashville Police Lt. Carlos Lara said previously. And you can be held accountable for their death. ... Were hoping itll make them think twice about dealing these drugs.
Prosecuting such cases is a tool that can deter people from dispensing and using opioids said Sumner County District Attorney Ray Whitley.
Cheatham County District Attorney Ray Crouch said he knew of several cases like these prosecuted in his district in recent years and the number will continue to rise.
The 2010 Tennessee Code specifies that second-degree murder could be defined in part as the killing of another that results from the unlawful distribution of any Schedule I or Schedule II drug when the drug is the proximate cause of the death of the user.
Crouch said since the statute was amended there's been a huge uptick in drug-related homicide charges particularly since opioid deaths have increased on a national scale.
State officials reported at least 1451 drug overdose deaths in Tennessee in 2015 though the actual number is likely higher by the hundreds a previous USA TODAY NETWORK  Tennessee report found.
The following year the estimate jumped to at least 1631 drug overdose deaths statewide according to the Tennessee Department of Health.
In Cheatham County more than 90 heroin overdoses  including more than five deaths  have been reported from January through September.
State data show deaths from fentanyl a synthetic opioid upped from 169 in 2015 to 294 in 2016 a previous report states.
Crouch said he believes prosecuting dealers selling fentanyl  That's what's killing everybody  with murder charges will have a deterring effect.
Lesser charges such as sale of a controlled substance could land the offender anything from a misdemeanor to a low-level felony he said whereas the minimum time serving a second-degree murder sentence is 15 years.
Crouch said the biggest challenge to prosecuting drug-induced homicide cases is whether there was a proper death scene investigation.
If law enforcement officials initially responding to the scene don't recognize drug overdose symptoms he said then the body might not be properly examined and there might not even be an autopsy performed.
I do think several overdose deaths have gone by in Tennessee where someone could have been charged Crouch said though he credited law enforcement officials for becoming more aware of the problem noting that he's seeing improvement in investigations.

In hindsight all the odd events added up.
The missing soda bottle caps and the vanishing spoons from the kitchen drawer. The hollow excuses and the irresponsible decisions.
How Heather Baltz would sleep through her infant son's cries and return to the tidy brick ranch-style home that she shared with her parents and two children in Donelson hours after her waitress shift ended. I had to help a friend Mom she would tell Tina Baltz.
And the money. Their once responsible daughter was suddenly always short of cash asking her dad for 50 or 100 to pay her phone bill or to get to the next paycheck.
I was a sucker said her father Mickey Baltz. I wasn't paying for her phone bill. I was paying for drugs.
I believe people when they tell me something. 'Course with her I believed it for way too long.
Heather Baltz died Feb. 23 during the reporting of this story of a heart infection doctors believe originated with a contaminated needle used to shoot heroin. She had turned to heroin after running out of pain pills prescribed for gallbladder surgery in 2014.
She was 28 and by then the Baltzes were long past denial.
For years the epicenter of the state's opioid crisis has been northeast Tennessee devastating small towns and rural communities that dot the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.
The state has the dubious distinction of having the second highest rate of opioid prescriptions in the nation.
In the past four years however the drug epidemic has crept steadily westward morphing into a heroin-driven public health crisis as opioid prescriptions became more closely regulated. People addicted to opioids turn to heroin a cheaper and more readily available opioid when medications such as oxycodone got harder to come by. They also turn to fentanyl a powerful opioid that can be cheaply manufactured in illegal labs and often proves fatal in small amounts.
Between 2014 and 2016 Nashville's drug overdose rates jumped by more than 71 percent a sudden spike that has left city health officials emergency responders and a porous safety net of treatment providers scrambling to catch up.
The city's drug overdose rates have now reached and in some instances surpassed rates in rural Appalachia according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Heather Baltz's death marked the family's most brutal encounter with Nashville's opioid and heroin crisis.
But it was not the only one.
In 2013 they were awakened by a 3 a.m. knock on the door. A Metro police chaplain informed them that Tina Baltz's brother 47-year-old Paul Shoulders Jr. had been killed in a car accident.
Shoulders was driving on Interstate 40 near Hermitage when his pickup was clipped by Robert Todd Harrell a former bassist for the band 3 Doors Down. Harrell was later convicted of vehicular homicide.
Todd Harrell case Ex-3 Doors Down bassist gets prison in deadly crash
He was speeding at 101 mph with the opioid oxycodone and the muscle relaxant alprazolam in his system. Last week Harrell was arrested again in Mississippi on unrelated drug gun and domestic violence charges and faces a revocation of his probation in Shoulders' death.
Then in 2016 a police chaplain came knocking again. This time it was to report the death of Heather's former boyfriend Ralph Hardin who lived with the Baltzes and was helping to raise the two children he and Heather shared together.
Hardin 29 was fatally shot with his own gun in a room at the Red Roof Inn where  the Baltzes say  he had gone to confront Heather's dealer. Police closed the case concluding Hardin may have accidentally shot himself.
Two days before his death Hardin had posted pictures of heroin paraphernalia on his Facebook page promising he would track down whoever had supplied drugs to Heather.
It was during Harrell's trial and its aftermath in late 2015 that the Baltzes confronted their daughter.
She said it was pills Tina Baltz said. We told her she needed to get help. She was scared to death. She was worried about what would happen to the kids and losing custody.
One day while the family attended Harrell's trial Heather leaned over to her mother and whispered that she had bought drugs from the same dealer who had supplied the man who killed her uncle.
For the next two years Heather was in and out of jail for stealing followed by three brief stints in rehab. Her parents kicked her out then welcomed her back in loaned her a car then demanded it back.
They formally took custody of the two children Heather left behind Braelyn 8 and Tyler 4 after Hardin's death. Heather agreed to the custody change.
Heather was high when she signed the papers Mickey Baltz said.
While Mickey Baltz who is 58 and his wife 50 were raising Heather's children they also were visiting pawn shops to buy back the jewelry the power washer and the iPad Heather sold to buy drugs. Her father was cruising neighborhoods where he thought Heather may be living.
Married for 29 years the couple also held down full-time jobs. Mickey Baltz works as an auto body technician. His wife works as an administrative assistant for an insurance company.
Tina Baltz said she felt like she was watching the brown-haired hazel-eyed sweet girl she raised simply disappear.
The whole time I was thinking will she ever be the same person again she said. And I didn't think so and she wasn't.
You see shows like 'Intervention' and we've watched them for years even before anything with Heather. And everyone starts out saying they were a happy child or a happy baby and then they go into the bad stuff. Then you think why was everyone who was a happy child go into that problem.
She was shy and she was a happy child. And then this happened.
Last year on Braelyn's birthday Heather called to say she wanted to see her daughter. She told her parents to meet her outside the Family Dollar store on Whites Creek Pike. They met for a meal and then Heather left walking west.
Mickey Baltz returned the next day driving down the side street on which he thought he'd seen her and noticed a house that was in the backdrop of a photograph Heather had texted him once before to prove to him she had not sold his car.
He called police. Heather had outstanding probation violations.
I thought at least in jail she wouldn't be doing drugs hopefully he said. When we saw her for Braelyn's birthday it was the worst I'd ever seen her. I'm thinking 'Now I can relax. She's safe in jail.' 
In court for her hearing she cussed me as she walked out the door as she was taken into custody he said.
Heather returned home in September but did little to care for her children. She never gave them a bath. She lay on the couch much of the time.
She'd been gone two years by then Tina Baltz said. I didn't push her to get up in the morning. I would get the kids up and feed them and take them to school. I wanted to give her time.
By January Heather appeared ill. She had bronchitis-like symptoms an ear infection a sty in her eye and a large abscess on her back. A visit to the emergency room ended with her being sent home with a diagnosis of stress.
Eighteen days later Heather was dead. Doctors at another hospital diagnosed a heart infection most likely caused by intravenous drug use.
The last few weeks of Heather's life were filled with frustration. Her parents had spent years dealing with Heather's addiction.
I got upset with her because she was just laying around her father said. I told her that if you don't do something you need to get out of my house.
I cannot regret anything I did or said because it will ruin me Tina Baltz said four months after her daughter's death. Then she closed her eyes and cried.
Sunday would have been Heather's 29th birthday. After church the Baltzes plan to visit her grave with the children.
I'm sure we'll maybe have some cake and ice cream with the kids so they can celebrate their mom's birthday Mickey Baltz said.

How big is the opioid problem in Nashville
In 2016 there were 178 fatal overdoses attributed to opioids and 70 to heroin. Those statistics do not include deaths from drug-related complications or homicides and auto fatalities involving drugs.
Nashville paramedics are now administering more than 100 doses of the opioid overdose drug Narcan each week.
In September the Metro Health Department hired its first opioid response coordinator.
A needle exchange program was created to stem the risks associated with shared needles. And police fire and emergency rooms are beginning to share data to get a handle on the epidemic.
But officials acknowledge they lag behind other major cities such as Columbus Ohio and Louisville Kentucky where the opioid crisis arrived sooner and is being addressed more aggressively.

How to get help
Need help for yourself or someone else dealing with addiction
The Tennessee REDLINE 1-800-889-9789 is a toll-free information and referral line funded by the Tennessee Department of Mental Health Substance Abuse Services.
NASHVILLE Tenn.--The Tennessee legislature will decide on Thursday whether or not to remove a local judge from her post due to alleged substance abuse issues and a failure to comply with terms of her previous suspensions.
In a January  the Board of Judicial Conduct memo of removal recommendation centers around Judge A. Melissa Boyd who serves as a Criminal Court Judge in the 30th Judicial District in Shelby County.
According to the recommendation Judge Boyd has received two public reprimands since taking the role in September 2022. One reprimand cited from May 8 2023 states within weeks of Judge Boyd assuming office she solicited resources and cash donations on social media for the benefit of a third party. Judge Boyd is said to have ignored the Board's inquiry into the matter but agreed to accept the reprimand.
On May 22 2023 Judge Boyd was suspended following allegations from a campaign manager who also had personal relations with the judge. According to affidavits filed by the former campaign manager the woman claims she discovered a plate with a spoon and what is believed to have been cocaine in the Judge's home closet. The affidavit states Judge Boyd admitted it was cocaine to the campaign manager and also admitted to smoking marijuana multiple times since being elected.
The affidavits go on to allege Judge Boyd was also seen outside the campaign manager's property in January 2023 taking pictures of the woman's car and property which she then texted to the woman. The affidavit stated Judge Boyd allegedly sent more texts asking who is the whore seriously Judge Body also allegedly sent the woman pictures of her prior marriage license and information about her divorce which made the woman feel disturbed.
The Board memo adds following the suspensions the Board gave Judge Boyd an opportunity to resign in November of last year but did not respond nor had she addressed substance abuse issues. In December of last year Judge Boyd was indicted on charges of coercion of a witness and harassment. Judge Boyd responded she had ultimately entered a rehab facility after the specified required dates and accused the Board of piling on her by keeping her off the bench.
On Thursday the Joint Ad Hoc Committee of the legislature will consider if Judge Boyd should be removed.
Michael Keaton's character in the new Hulu series Dopesick is based in part on the life story of Nashville addiction specialist  and former opioid abuser  Dr. Stephen Loyd.
Keaton plays Dr. Samuel Finnix the caring physician in a small Appalachian mining town  a physician who gets addicted to the pain pills he starts prescribing. Dopesick is a fictionalized version of reporter Beth Macy's book of the same name about the country's opioid crisis and the irresponsible marketing of Purdue Pharma's addictive painkiller OxyContin.
Loyd the former Tennessee opioid epidemic czar himself once abused pain pills taking as many as 100 a day.
Loyd a 54-year-old Knoxville area native got connected with Dopesick producers through Robert Pack a nationally renowned pain pills expert and an associate dean for East Tennessee State University Loyd's medical school alma mater.
Pack is a source for the book Dopesick and author Macy also is a writer for the TV series.
He kept saying You have to interview Dr. Steve He was right Macy said in an email to The Tennessean.
Its Loyd's passion and his knowledge both  hes so very well read about addiction  and then you layer his personal experience on top of it and hes got it all.
Loyd spent several hours on Zoom calls with the TV series' writers one day and Macy sent Loyd follow up questions after that.
ReviewMichael Keaton's opioid drama 'Dopesick' is harrowing horrifying and a must-watch
Acclaimed doctorHer parents tried to stop her from going to college now she's a world-class oncologist
Helping othersFirst a Metro cop then a preacher Now he says he finally found his best way to help kids
We are grateful to him for serving as a direct inspiration Macy said.
The Keaton character is a composite of several doctors we personally know about but Dr. Steve is the one who helped us most directly in the room and afterwards.
Loyd now serves as medical director for Cedar Recovery addiction treatment centers in Middle Tennessee which mostly serves the uninsured or those on public insurance like TENNCare or Medicaid.

NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  It's an animal tranquilizer now being found in illicit drugs.
Xylazine is a veterinary sedative or a veterinary tranquilizer Dr. Josh Schrecker senior director of clinical affairs at Aegis Sciences Corporation.
Known as 'tranq' the drug is being detected in opioid supplies like fentanyl across the country. According to a White House press release xylazine-positive overdose deaths increased by 1127 in the South 750 in the west more than 500 in the Midwest and more than 100 in the northeast between 2020 and 2021.
So if you get a certain amount of a prescription opioid or an illicit opioid adding an adulterant to that drug may allow you to expand your supply while also retaining some of the effects that an end user may be wanting when they're buying that drug said Schrecker.
But unlike opioids Xylazine can't be reversed by Naloxone.
It acts on a totally different receptor site than a prescription or an illicit opioid said Schrecker.
Aegis began expanding testing for drugs like xylazine about a year ago. Since then positivity rates have increased  so has demand for testing.
So providers are utilizing our test results to understand what sort of exposure or use has occurred in that individual to better make decisions going forward as to how to appropriately treat that person Schrecker said.
As one of the only labs that offers this kind of testing Aegis tests about 4000 samples a month that are shipped throughout the country.
But as with most trends Schrecker said the drug supply may change.
So in six months eight months 12 months we're likely going to be dealing with a different drug that has different effects. We need to be prepared for that.
Despite modest numbers in Nashville deadly overdoses connected to 'tranq' are on the rise. In 2019 xylazine was detected in six fatal overdoses. By 2022 the drug was detected in 40 deadly overdoses.

To begin 2023 Tennessee prisons added another layer of screening with new scanners that can see contraband inside bodies.
Listen
A cardboard box at the post office. Thats how Judy Fritts brother-in-law came home. Last month he died of a suspected drug overdose at a private prison in Hartsville Tennessee. Now hes a pile of ashes.
They did an autopsy. Were waiting on the results from that she says. And they just pretty much said you know that that they were sorry for our loss. And that was it.
Fritts was shocked at first. But then she started scrolling through a Facebook group where she read one post after the next about people who had lost brothers and fathers in the same facility. She realized that what had happened to her brother-in-law has become increasingly common within Tennessees prisons.
As overdoses have spiked nationwide during the pandemic they have also ravaged the facilities that are supposed to be most secure. Neither barbed wire nor X-ray screenings have kept out deadly substances.
Drug deaths have jumped more than eightfold in Tennessees prisons in just the past two years from six in 2019 to 49 last year. Nearly all were from the highly potent opioid fentanyl. That has left people inside their loved ones and even officials feeling desperate.
I think everybody just needs to remember that somewhere somewhere people are loving the people that are in prison Fritts says. Theyre human being and they have families that are grieving on the outside.
If hes in prison he shouldnt be able to get drugs
Fritts says she and her family had been loving her brother-in-law from afar for years. She says he had cycled in and out of prison spent some time on the street and gotten addicted to drugs somewhere along the way. His father also struggled with substance use and died of an overdose.
When he was locked up again a few years ago Fritts was actually a little relieved. At least he would have a warm place to sleep. She thought he would be safe.
I guess I was kind of naï¿½ve about the way the whole prison worked she says. I was thinking if hes in prison he shouldnt be able to get drugs.
Now Fritts feels torn.
Somebodys an adult and in charge of their own life and they need to take responsibility for themselves she says.
But she also feels guilty  like she should have done more to protect him.
I thought if somebody does something wrong and theyre in there thats just the way it is until they pay their crime and then they get out and hopefully dont ever go back Fritts says. But this whole thing has made me kind of realize that the prison system is broken. It just doesnt seem to work.
Until recently fatal overdoses in Tennessee prisons were rare. There were no confirmed drug toxicity deaths in 2017 according to the Department of Correction. But in the last two years at least 68 people have died from drugs not including deaths with pending autopsies. There were even more close calls during that period. Staff administered overdose-reversal drugs almost 900 times.
The spike in overdoses follows a national trend  both behind bars and beyond them. But Wanda Bertram from the Prison Policy Initiative says incarcerated people face an especially high risk.
Prisons are very isolating places she says.
During much of the pandemic Bertram notes in-person visitation was halted in prisons. People were not able to see their families for months as outbreaks of the contagious virus tore through penitentiaries where people live in close quarters. Outside volunteers were also barred for many months.
Bertram says regular exposure to violence also takes a toll on peoples mental health. Plus it can be hard to get medical care.
Dr. Homer Venters an expert on correctional health told WPLN News last year that prison health care systems were struggling to keep up before the pandemic. He said COVID-19 has further limited access to medical treatment.
You might turn to drugs to self-medicate Bertram says.
Its a daily battle
Addiction affects about two thirds of people in U.S. prisons according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Pair that with the growing presence of fentanyl and youve got a dangerous situation. That drug can be up to 50 times stronger than heroin.
But one of the most proven therapies for addiction Medication-Assisted Treatment is nearly impossible to access in Tennessee prisons. The Department of Correction says just five people in its custody are currently receiving MAT which prescribes people medications like Suboxone to curb their cravings. Thats out of about 20000 individuals in prison. Everyone else is stuck with whatever unregulated substances are sneaking inside.
Its a significant issue that we face each and every day outgoing corrections commissioner Tony Parker testified at a state senate corrections subcommittee meeting last fall. He said the department is installing body scanners and checking the perimeters for drugs.
We also have a very aggressive law enforcement division that works both with federal partners state partners and local to mitigate some of the issues that we see with drug interdiction Parker said. But chairman its an ongoing battle. Its a daily battle to fight these drugs in our facilities.
Several prison employees have been arrested for bringing in contraband in recent years. TDOC also said in an email that it is working to get more people into treatment including with medication and a new peer program that teaches people how to help one another through recovery.
State-run prisons however are just one piece of the puzzle. Overdoses are also spiking in Tennessees for-profit prisons which are operated by Brentwood-based CoreCivic. The company has its own drug treatment programs including both a nine- to 12-month residential treatment program and outpatient care for less severe cases. A spokesperson also says CoreCivic has a zero-tolerance policy for contraband.
But Jason Carnett says their Trousdale Turner facility was the worst place he could have been sent as someone with a substance use disorder. He was there until last fall and he says drug were all around him.
It breaks the monotony I guess Carnett says.
He says the prison is a haven of depression and anger and paranoia. Drugs he says are an escape.
I probably would have overdosed
Carnett 35 has struggled with drug dependency for most of his life. He says he smoked marijuana for the first time when he was 11. Later he started to steal his parents prescription drugs. At 15 he says he was prescribed painkillers after getting hit by a car. Carnetts addiction kept landing him in jail and prison. During his latest stint behind bars he says he was using drugs just about every day.
Courtesy Jason Carnett
Carnett says he mostly stayed away from fentanyl. But one day he says someone put a pack of it in his hand while he was on the phone.
After Carnett hung up he went back to his cell and opened the paper towel. His hands had sweat so much during the 30 minutes he was on the phone that he says the fentanyl had mostly dissolved.
Carnett got lucky. He says one of his friends overdosed that night.
If it wouldnt have dissolved I probably would have overdosed he says.
Carnett was released in September and says hes now getting meds to treat his addiction along with mental health therapy.
But he wont forget all the overdoses he saw in prison. The stream of stretchers rolling past his cell. Those are seared into his mind.
Im just glad I made it out of there he says.

NASHVILLE Tenn.The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services TDMHSAS is releasing new data showing the response to the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline in the state.
The three-digit number for the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline launched in mid-July 2022 after two years of planning preparation and expansion. In Tennessee that included distributing about 2.8 million in federal funding to community-based crisis call centers to hire dozens of new staff.
The preparation paid off with about 21000 Tennessee calls to 988 in the last six months of 2022. Thats an increase of about 500 calls per month over the previous 10-digit National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number. Tennesseans are also taking advantage of 988s ability to text or chat. In the last half of 2022 there were nearly 10000 texts to 988 and chats with 988lifeline.org from people in Tennessee.
Its never been easier to connect with mental health care in a crisis thanks to 988. Our state has an amazing network of crisis services and community mental health providers and 988 is unlocking the door to mental health help that so many people need right now said TDMHSAS Commissioner Marie Williams. We are grateful to our community partners who expanded to meet the demand and continue to respond to needs in a caring and compassionate way.
Even with the increased demand for assistance Tennessees crisis call centers are meeting or exceeding national benchmarks for in-state answer rate and time to answer. The federal agency that funds the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline sets targets at 90 in-state and 30 seconds. Any call thats not answered promptly in-state rolls over to a national backup call center so that no call goes unanswered.
The power of 988 and Tennessees crisis services continuum means that not only are you talking to someone in Tennessee the call-taker is probably in your region and knows the resources and probably has personal contacts who can help said TDMHSAS Director of Crisis Services and Suicide Prevention Jennifer Armstrong.
After the strong start in 2022 TDMHSAS is adding additional capacity in Nashville Knoxville and West Tennessee utilizing 1 million in supplemental funding from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and existing Mental Health Block Grant Funding. The department previously expanded chat and text capabilities in September 2022 to meet the demand during peak times.
Weve long said that we were going to follow the data in our approach to 988 and weve done just that. Were constantly learning more about how Tennesseans want to access help in a mental health crisis and increasingly that doesnt involve speaking to someone on the phone. said Matt Yancey LCSW TDMHSAS Deputy Commissioner for Community Behavioral Health Programs. Were grateful for the flexibility of our crisis call centers and their amazing staff as we work together to meet the need and connect people to care.

In recent years Tennessee policymakers have enacted a series of measures to combat the state's growing opioid problem
2015 Lawmakers enact legislation tightening the requirements for medical directors and owners of pain management clinics. The new law requires medical directors or owners of pain clinics to be licensed physicians who hold required continuing medical education and sub-specialty certifications in pain medicine.
2015 The Intractable Pain Treatment Act is repealed with the support of the states district attorneys and the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. The 2001 measure included a Pain Patients Bill of Rights which gave patients a great amount of responsibility to choose opiate medications as a first line of treatment and physicians were required either to provide requested opiate medication or refer patients to physicians who would.
2014 Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam announces a seven-point plan to address the state's opioid abuse problem that includes public education law enforcement and regulatory oversight of the medical community.
2014 New guidelines issued by the Tennessee Department of Health set limits on the daily doses of opioids doctors may prescribe and spell out protocols for giving the drugs to women of child-bearing age and establish new certification requirements for pain medication specialists.
2013 Dispensing of controlled substances by pain management clinics is prohibited.
2013 Tennessee begins to require health care professionals to check the Controlled Substance Monitoring Database before prescribing a controlled substance.
2013 Legislation limits to 30 days prescriptions for drugs categorized as Schedule II and Schedule III which include a range of opioid medications. The law also requires physicians to perform urine drug tests if they prescribe these medications beyond 30 days.
2013 A new law to combat prescription fraud requires medical professionals to use tamper-resistant paper for all written prescriptions.
2012 The Prescription Safety Act sponsored by Sen. Ken Yager R-Harriman is the first sweeping legislation to address opioid abuse. It expanded the required use of the state's prescription drug database originally created as a research tool requiring pharmacists to check the database before filling prescriptions update the database once a week instead of once per month and making the database available to law enforcement. The law also allowed pharmacists and the Department of Health to share prescription information across state lines and elevated some types of doctor-shopping to a felony.

The drug overdose crisis in Davidson County continues to escalate experts say and members of the Metro Council's Public Health and Safety Committee are seeking ways to curb the death toll.
On Thursday evening at Nashville's Historic Metro Courthouse three experts on the front lines of the fight against drug overdose deaths presented to the committee including Mary Linden Salter executive director of the Tennessee Association of Alcohol Drug and other Addiction Services Josh Love an epidemiologist with the drug overdose response unit in the Metro Health Department and DeWayne Holman executive director of the Nashville Prevention Partnership.
Fatal drug overdoses in Tennessee have accelerated sharply since the early- to mid-2010s. In 2020 the most recent year data is available the state recorded over 3000 overdose deaths an increase of 44 compared to 2019 and Tennessees deadliest year ever. Preliminary data suggested that the state was on pace to exceed that number in 2021.
But Councilmember Erin Evans the committee chair who organized the meeting said the committee has typically discussed the epidemic only when accepting grants rarely focusing on the awareness side of things. That changed on Thursday night.
Salter explained the science behind addiction. Addiction is a disease she said. With addiction treatment what we try to do is reprogram the brain and find opportunities where we can teach people new skills and help them use new neuropathways.
She lauded legislation that would enhance efforts to combat the crisis including a bill that would widen access to naloxone in Tennessee.
But Salter also called on committee members to help address the states provider shortage in addiction recovery treatment. Figuring out how to build a more robust workforce would be extremely helpful she said.
Love presented data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention comparing Tennessee and Davidson County to peer communities across the nation. Tennessee he said ranks fourth nationwide in overdose death rates and sixth nationwide in the number of annual overdose deaths.

MoreFentanyl testing strips and Narcan to stop overdoses Where to find them in the South
Meanwhile a Metro Health Department analysis of CDC data found that of the nations 3100 counties Davidson ranked 30th in the total number of overdose deaths reported.
Love attributed the crisis in large part to the rise of fentanyl a highly potent opioid that is inexpensive and easy to produce. Lethal even in very small quantities fentanyl often comes mixed with other substances or in the form of counterfeit pills leading to accidental overdoses by people who believe they are taking a different drug.
The Davidson County District Attorneys office estimates that two out of every five counterfeit pills seized contain a lethal dose of fentanyl Love said.

Committee members also learned about the wide range of support and harm reduction programs in place for residents of Davidson County. Holmans presentation included a discussion of spike alerts by text which track a communitys overdose patterns and the Tennessee REDLINE a free 247 hotline for addiction treatment referrals.
These programs and other similar initiatives could soon see an influx of funding. Mayor John Coopers office announced on Thursday that Davidson County will receive 23 million from the multibillion-dollar settlement between local governments and the nations largest opioid manufacturers and distributors. The state of Tennessee and its counties collectively will receive 613 million.
At-large Council member Sharon Hurt thanked the speakers for their efforts to combat the drug crisis.
The work that theyre doing is invaluable she said. It is making a difference in our community.
NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  The fight against opioid abuse continues and soon you'll see a form of overdose treatment at your drugstore. It's a big move that's causing both excitement and concern.
In Metro Nashville the number of deaths due to overdose has gone up every year since 2016. In the first half of 2023 332 people have died due to overdoses in the first half of this year. For the first time an opioid overdose blocker will be available over the counter as soon as next week.
The FDA approved the Narcan nasal spray for public use in March. According to data from Nashville.gov in 2022 and 2023 when someone has died due to an overdose over 75 of the time fentanyl was detected.
The second highest reported substance detected was cocaine at 42 for this year.
In early September you should start seeing it in the big retailers like a Walgreens and a Walmart. And as we go through the month of September access and availability of Narcan will continue to spread to regional grocery stores independent pharmacies and the like said Matt Hartwig with Emergent BioSolutions.
There is some concern about the price tag and whether people who need it can afford it.
A box will cost just under 50 and it'll include two doses.
'If it's going to be something if people don't have necessarily somebody in their immediate circle that they're concerned about. I think that 44.99 is pretty expensive said overdose awareness advocate Michelle Leopold.
In Nashville the Metro Public Health Department partnered with an organization called Partnership to End Addiction for an auto text program that sends you notifications about spikes in overdose activity in the county. It's free and anyone can sign up for it by texting SPIKE to 1 855 963-5669 855-9-OD-KNOW and following the prompts.
NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  Tuesday May 9 marks National Fentanyl Awareness Day as efforts continue to shed light on the deadly drug. It's one that has caused more overdose deaths than ever before.
The drug has caused a lot of problems in Nashville. In just the first quarter of 2023 there have been more than 140 suspected drug overdose deaths. Of those fentanyl played a part in more than 75 percent of them.
Health experts and leaders across the country are sounding the alarm yet again about how potent this drug can be. Nationwide fentanyl is involved in more deaths of people under 50 than any other cause of death including heart disease cancer homicide and suicide.
According to the CDC more than 107000 people in the U.S. died of drug overdoses and drug poisonings between January 2021 and January 2022. A staggering 67 percent of those deaths involved synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Some of those deaths were tied to fentanyl mixed with other illicit drugs like cocaine meth and heroin.
It only takes two milligrams of fentanyl for it to be considered a potentially lethal dose and it's a drug thats especially dangerous for someone who does not have a tolerance to opioids.
NASHVILLE Tenn.March 10 2020 is being proclaimed as Tennessees Day of Hope by Governor Bill Lee. The proclamation is in recognition of community events planned across the state to educate energize and empower Tennesseans to do what they can to get involved and reverse the trends of deadly drug overdoses and suicides.
The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services its Faith-Based Community Coordinators Lifeline Peer Project Coordinators and Substance Abuse Prevention Coalitions across the state have organized Day of Hope events that include information on addiction what treatment looks like connecting to recovery supports opioid overdose reversal and suicide prevention.

While evidence-based treatment and recovery services are foundational to overcoming substance use disorder or mental illness there is powerful motivation for change found in the act of hope. Whether its hope for a new life in recovery hope for long-prayed-for reconnection with family or hope for healing and happiness hope is a force for good in our state said TDMHSAS Commissioner Marie Williams LCSW.
ASHLAND CITY Tenn. WTVF  More than half of drug overdoses in Nashville are linked back to fentanyl.
It's not just a Metro problem it's all across the state. One mother knows this unfortunately too well.
Tonya Garton buried her son a year ago after a fentanyl overdose.
She says her mission now is to help save more lives.
My 20-year-old son Quintenn passed away on March 2 2021 from a fentanyl overdose Garton said.
There's not a day that goes by Garton said she doesn't think about her son.
Quintenn Clark played football and baseball. Garton said he was a good kid and never got into trouble.
This was until he was introduced to Xanax as a senior in high school.
He got kicked out of high school and... small colleges were looking at him for baseball. He lost all of the baseball. He couldn't join the military at that point Garton said.
Garton says her son was sober for a full year in January but she noticed that he was starting to act a little erratic by February.
It was that March day when she got the call that Clark wasn't breathing.
Clark joins a growing list of people killed from a fentanyl overdose. It's a synthetic opioid pain reliever that has been the main driver in the increased number of drug overdose deaths in Middle Tennessee.
Cheatham County where he lived had the highest in the whole entire state overdoses at the time said Garton.
The Cheatham County Sheriff's Office said so far this year there have been 11 deaths and more than 50 fentanyl overdoses.
Less than 60 miles east in Nashville nearly 80 of overdose-related toxicology reports in 2022 have detected fentanyl.
Just this week Metro Nashville Police Department released information that three men were found unresponsive from suspected fentanyl overdoses. Two men died.
Joshua Wolfe 34 of Elkhorn Nebraska and Karl Smith 25 of Lac la Biche Alberta Canada died. The survivor who was revived after being administered Naloxone is a 26-year-old friend of Wolfe and is also from Elkhorn Nebraska.
Detectives are reviewing downtown surveillance footage in an effort to determine who if anyone may have sold or given the victims an illicit drug. The surviving victim has met with detectives but said he does not remember what took place.
All we can do is continue continue continue to bring more awareness to this said Bruce Hill the founder of Recovery Warriors What Was Is No More a nonprofit organization helping those struggling with addiction. Hill said one time he was an addict and now he wants to help others.
If we don't get this back in our schools and start teaching these children what's going on We're not going to make it Hill said.
Hill would like to see Tennessee teach students the dangers of drugs as a curriculum.
As for Garton she has started the Quintenn Clark Foundationin memory of her son.
We started it with a thought that we could reach just one person just one person. Then his death wouldn't be in vain Garton said.
The foundations purpose is to provide resources for the treatment of addiction community awareness and support for families affected by addiction and education for drug abuse.
For those seeking treatment for drug addiction the Community Overdose Response Team CORT can help.
CORT is a free and confidential resource to help find drug and alcohol treatment for individuals who are at risk of an overdose.
The service is offered free of charge regardless of health insurance status. The team works with an individual to determine the appropriate level of care e.g. detox residential or outpatient treatment etc..

The opioid crisis has been devastating to Tennessee. And it's getting worse.
More than 9100 people have died of drug overdoses in Tennessee between 2013 and 2018 according to state death data. More than 70 of those deaths were at least partially caused by opioids including prescription painkillers heroin or fentanyl.
The ongoing opioid crisis  the deadliest drug epidemic in American history  was largely sparked by the overprescription and abuse of prescription medications. Painkillers like OxyContin were prescribed frequently and in large dosages leading many patients to become dependent or addicted to these drugs.
PAINKILLERSThis pain clinic nurse gave a patient 51 pills a day. And she kept her license.
Tennessee later adopted laws and regulations to cut back these prescriptions but the damage was already done. People who had become addicted to prescription painkillers could still feed their addiction with heroin or black market pills.
Opioid prescriptions have now become weaker and less common in Tennessee but deaths have only grown.
As more people have flocked to the black market the drugs they use have become deadlier.
Heroin is chemically similar to prescription painkillers but far stronger and more dangerous. And heroin is often laced with fentanyl an exceptionally powerful synthetic opioid that is about 100 times more potent than morphine. A lethal dose is no larger than a few grains of sand.
Fentanyl was once virtually unknown outside of hospitals but has now grown to become one of the deadliest substances in America.
Why is our opioid crisis getting worse
You can pretty much explain it with a one-word answer fentanyl said Trevor Henderson Nashvilles opioid response coordinator.
HOW TO HELPNarcan a life-saving anti-overdose drug is now sold online in Tennessee
Many states have begun to turn a corner on the opioid crisis but Tennessee has not.
Nationwide overdose deaths dropped 2.2 between March 2018 and March 2019 according to the U.S. Census Bureau which tallies and estimates drug fatalities.
Deaths have also dropped dramatically in many of the states that have been hit hardest by the opioid crisis Ohio -12.4 Pennsylvania -11.5 Michigan -10.3 Florida -6.6 and Kentucky -8.2.
In Tennessee deaths rose 7.3 over the same period.
Those deaths are not entirely caused by opioids however.
This census data includes all drug deaths and Tennessee has also recorded a rise in deaths linked to methamphetamine and cocaine. Cocaine deaths dropped in 2018 but have risen overall since the opioid crisis began.
Many of these deaths are the result of intermingled drugs combining stimulants and opioids in a way that magnifies the danger of both according to law enforcement.
And fentanyl is increasingly found laced into not only heroin but also meth and cocaine.
We have been sounding the alarm and beating the drum so much trying to warn people that what they are buying may not be what it appears said T.J. Jordan assistant director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations drug division. What you take today may simply kill you tomorrow. And no one is heeding that warning.

The Metro Public Health Department in Nashville announced its participation in a new text notification program to alert the public of spikes in overdose activity. MPHD will be the only jurisdiction in Tennessee participating in this new project with Partnership to End Addiction. Public health officials hope to reach those who are at risk of suffering an overdose and their families quickly by text notifications.
Alarming levels of drug overdoses are being reported in Nashville and Middle Tennessee. More people have died in the first four months of 2021 due to drug overdose than in the first four months of 2020 and drug overdoses have steadily risen over the past five years according to MPHD.
Those interested in receiving text updates should text SPIKE to 1-855-963-5669. If you are interested in receiving more information you can send an email to Opioid.ResponseNashville.gov
MPHD continuously monitors data about drug use and outcomes across different communities in Middle Tennessee and uses several data sources to detect increases in overdoses occurring in the community.
Josh Love an epidemiologist for MPHD said the department studies changes in the number of fatal and nonfatal overdoses ages and locations and the types of drugs used. Spikes are classified as a number higher than the daily average. The summer is a peak season for overdose spiking but prediction is hard which is why the text program will help get information to the public as it becomes available.
MPHD also recommends family and friends of those at risk of a drug overdose recognize common signs such as unresponsiveness light blue or grey coloring on lips and fingertips shallow breaths and gurgling or snoring sounds.
When encountering a person who may have overdosed call 911 and stay with the person until help arrives.
The MPHD website has information about proper drug disposal drug lock boxes a syringe services program and more.

NASHVILLE Tenn. AP  A former Tennessee correctional officer will receive 160000 in back pay and damages after he was forced to resign for taking Suboxone to treat his opioid use disorder if a judge approves a landmark consent decree filed in federal court in Nashville on Wednesday.
It is the first time the U.S. Department of Justice has used the Americans with Disabilities Act to settle a claim that an employee was discriminated against for taking a prescribed medication to treat drug addiction according to the Department.
It comes less than a year after the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division issued new guidelines advising that employers health care providers law enforcement agencies that operate jails and others are violating the ADA if they discriminate against people taking prescription medications to treat opioid use disorder. The Department noted federal law does not protect people who are using illegal drugs.
In the present case the complainant who is not identified by name was hired as a correctional officer at the Cumberland County jail in January 2015. He received positive employment evaluations and was even promoted but when a drug screen showed he was taking Suboxone to treat his opioid addiction in 2018 he was given the choice of resigning or being fired for drug use.
The complaint filed in federal court Wednesday claims a Cumberland Countys sheriffs office policy prohibiting employees from being on controlled substances while at work fails to make individualized assessments of its employees ability to perform the essential functions of their jobs ... when they are taking legally prescribed medications.
In addition to providing 160000 to the former employee the county has agreed to revise its employment policies and implement training around ADA compliance as part of a consent decree also filed Wednesday. The decree wont become final until approved by a judge. An initial case management conference is scheduled for Friday.
Drugs like Suboxone often carry a stigma because they contain opioids but Dr. Marc Stern a correctional physician who is on faculty at the University of Washington School of Public Health said they should not.
When these drugs are prescribed for someone who has a disorder it helps them be normal. It helps them be healthy. It helps them to hold a job Stern said. More importantly the Department of Justice has spoken and this is the law. Its not up to employers to decide whether they like it or not.
Because of how opioids act on the brain people dependent on them get sick if they stop using. Withdrawal can feel like a bad flu with cramping sweating anxiety and sleeplessness. Cravings for the drug can last for years and be so intense that relapse is common. Suboxone is a common form of buprenorphine a gold standard medicine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that reduces cravings.
Overdose deaths in the U.S. remain at near-record levels. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that overdoses contributed to more than 107000 deaths in the 12 months that ended Aug. 31. Opioids were involved in more than 81000 of those.
The proposed consent decree in Tennessee comes as President Joe Bidens administration pushes for greater access to addiction treatment. Most recently Biden signed a law eliminating the need for doctors to get a special waiver to prescribe buprenorphine. He has also released a national drug control strategy that for the first time prioritizes preventing death and illness in drug users while trying to engage them in care and treatment.

AP Medical Writer Carla K. Johnson in Washington state contributed to this report.
An investigation by the Tennessee Comptrollers Office shows that a Nashville-based nonprofit used grant money to make 42249.74 of unallowable payments including checks written to the executive director.
Successful Survivors is a nonprofit that assists individuals with mental illness and substance abuse issues. In 2018 the organization partnered with the Tennessee Department of Mental Health  Substance Abuse Services MHSAS to obtain 299670 in grant funds to purchase and renovate a home in Nashville to use as a rehabilitation house.
Investigators determined the executive director used these grant funds to pay himself developer fees totaling 27000. The executive director told investigators that he believed he deserved the payment for facilitating the property purchase and overseeing the renovation. Successful Survivors did not receive approval from MHSAS to pay these developer fees and failed to provide any written documentation justifying the payments.
Additionally investigators found that 4000 in grant funds was donated to the Greater Heights Missionary Baptist Church where the executive director of Successful Survivors serves as pastor. Contributions and donations are prohibited according to the Code of Federal Regulation grant guidelines.
Successful Survivors also failed to provide invoices or receipts for 34 payments totaling 9404.11 related to the renovation of the Nashville home and paid miscellaneous unallowable taxes totaling 1845.63 with grant funds.
Other findings noted by investigators include Successful Survivors filing false information with the Internal Revenue Service and Tennessee Secretary of State.
The results of this investigation have been communicated to the Office of the District Attorney General of the 20th Judicial District.
Nonprofits must ensure they collect and retain adequate documentation to support grant expenditures said Comptroller Mumpower. Its also vital the Board of Directors provide adequate oversight to implement internal controls over financial reporting and other operations.

Police have arrested and charged a fourth person with second degree murder in connection with the fatal Fentanyl overdose of a 38-year-old woman in Hermitage last year.
Najir Ellis was arrested in Clarksville this week in connection with the death of Nicole Aylward.
Aylward died April 3 2015 from a Fentanyl and heroin overdose at Shannon Wise and Joseph Thompson's Central Pike apartment. Both Wise and Thompson were immediately charged with second degree murder and a number of felony drug charges.
Aylward had suffered a non-fatal overdose in that same apartment just days earlier.
Narcotics detectives say the two provided Aylward with the Fentanyl a prescription opioid typically used to manage severe pain.
As detectives continued to work on this case they identified Michael Lacefield 28 and Ellis 19 as the persons who originally sold and delivered the Fentanyl-laced heroin to the apartment according to police.
Lacefield was arrested last year.
Because Ellis was 17 years old when Aylward died police have charged him in juvenile court.
The second degree murder charges against Wise Thompson and Lacefield are pending in Davidson County criminal court police say. They're scheduled to appear in court Dec. 15.
Indicted in the same case on felony heroin charges is James Cooke 39 who police said shipped the Fentanyl-laced heroin from Detroit to Nashville.

NASHVILLE Tenn.The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services TDMHSAS applauds the Food and Drug Administration decision to make the opioid overdose reversal drug Narcan available without a prescription. Tennessee has had a statewide collaborative pharmacy practice agreement in place since 2016 allowing pharmacists to dispense naloxone to customers without a conventional prescription but this decision at the federal level will expand the availability of the life-saving medication even further.
While the ruling will take some time to implement the departments long-standing and highly successful training education and naloxone distribution program is still in effect. TDMHSAS has trained Tennesseans on how to recognize and respond to an overdose including the use of naloxone since October 2017 through its Regional Overdose Prevention Specialist ROPS program. In addition ROPS have provided Narcan and other forms of naloxone the opioid overdose antidote to high-risk individuals law enforcement and community agencies. In that time the ROPS have distributed more than 450000 units of naloxone resulting in more than 60000 reported lives saved.
What weve seen with our ROPS and what we know through our community partners is that naloxone saves lives and more naloxone in the hands of Tennesseans at risk of overdose and those who love them is a good thing said TDMHSAS Commissioner Marie Williams LCSW. Were excited about the interest around naloxone and reversing an overdose and we want people to continue to lean on our ROPS for training and naloxone if needed.
Tennessee will receive more than 25 million in federal funding to combat the opioid crisis which has killed more than 5000 people in the state according to a Trump administration announcement earlier this week.
About 18.5 million will be given to the state government by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to fund opioid addiction prevention treatment and recovery programs. The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention will provide another 6.7 million to the state health department to help collect overdose data in real time and support the effort to prevent more deaths.
The Tennessee funding is part of nearly 1.8 billion in opioid crisis grants be dolled out nationwide. President Trump announced the funding on Wednesday while vaguely criticizing past administrations for not doing enough to combat addiction.
We want a safe and healthy future for every American family. Thats what I said wed do and thats what we are in the process of doing Trump said during a press conference.
He added later My administration is determined to use every resource at our disposal to smash the grip of addiction.
The opioid epidemic has hit hard in Tennessee and while the crisis is slowing in other states it is still growing here. About 5500 people died from opioid-related overdoses in the state between 2013 and 2017 according to state overdose records. CDC data shows that another 1800 died of drug overdoses in Tennessee in 2018 but it is not yet known how many of those overdoses were linked to opioids. Many nearby states saw dramatic drops in overdoses deaths in 2018 but Tennessee did not.
State epidemiologist Dr. Tim Jones said last month that Tennessee has made significant progress cutting down on prescription opioid abuse but these gains had been outweighed by the rise of fentanyl.
We were once close to the top of the pile in terms of prescription opioid use abuse and therefore deaths Jones said. Unfortunately as weve decreased opioid prescriptions there are still people who are really dependent and it can drive to heroin fentanyl and other drugs.

Tennessees outgoing chief addiction expert said the only way to make a real dent in overdose deaths is the controversial practice of using opioids to reduce cravings.
If you truly want to make an impact you have to embrace that practice said Dr. Stephen Loyd who resigned effective Monday from his job as medical director for the states substance abuse services division.
Loyd 50 left his job to accept the role of co-medical director at a private drug rehab center JourneyPure at the River in Murfreesboro.
Loyd did so after working for the state for two years making hundreds of presentations across Tennessee on drug addiction and serving as an advisor on Gov. Bill Haslams new 30 million plan to battle the opioid epidemic. Most of the money would be used for addiction treatment with some going toward more law enforcement and prevention efforts.
At least 1631 Tennesseans died from drug overdoses  most of those from pain pills called opioids  in 2016 a 12 percent jump from 2015 according to the Tennessee Department of Health.
Loyd said Haslams plan to battle the opioid epidemic is a very good start.
Is it enough he added. No.
Loyd  himself a recovering addict  said medical professionals need to embrace the practice of using opioids like Buprenorphine Sub Oxone and methadone to get addicts off drugs like heroin and Oxycodone.
Any opioid however has a significant chance for abuse making their use controversial in the recovery community.
 More Loyd former pill abuser now battles drug epidemic in Tennessee
 More Governor unveils 30 million plan to battle TN opioid crisis
Loyd and several other Tennessee addiction specialists agree the best approach to recovery is inpatient rehab treatment followed by outpatient monitoring and support groups.
But Loyd and two other experts  Vanderbilt medical school Professor Dan Lonergan and Cumberland Heights chief medical officer Chapman Sledge  also agree residential treatment is too expensive for or otherwise not accessible to most addicts who need it.
So Lonergan said he agrees 100 percent with Loyd that doctors and public health officials should embrace using Buprenorphine and other drugs to wean addicts off their drugs of choice.
Lonergan also said studies have shown medication-assisted treatment is more effective than abstinence-based programs.
In a statement issued Wednesday Feb. 7 the state Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services indicated Tennessee would be open to the use of Sub Oxone and methadone.
We know that no single method of treatment works for all patients with substance use disorder Commissioner Marie Williams said in the statement but we believe that if properly prescribed administered and monitored harm reduction drugs can be effective in helping some patients overcome their addiction issues.
Sledge from Cumberland Heights isnt as quick to embrace using opioids for recovery. He said he has been having good results with an opioid-blocking drug called naltrexone found in the Vivitrol injections some recovering addicts get to keep them from using.
Loyd said the main reason he switched jobs was to get back to directly treating patients.
His new boss said JourneyPure is open to all approaches and to matching patients with best treatment for their individual needs. Right now JourneyPure offers abstinence-based treatment at four residential facilities across the state.
JourneyPure is based on innovation and research said Sam MacMaster co-founder and chief clinical officer for the Nashville-based company. We are open to matching individuals with the best possible service to help end this epidemic and overdose deaths.
The company now uses Vivitrol for some residential patients. JourneyPure provides medication-assisted recovery including using Sub Oxone in some outpatient clinics.

Outgoing Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery recently claimed victory in a 450 million national settlement with Ireland-based drugmaker Endo International yet five years ago he tried to derail legal efforts in Northeast Tennessee that led to a 35 million settlement thats netting more money for nine counties than his Endo deal brought for the entire state.
The settlement negotiated by district attorneys general and their outside counsel also went directly to local governments for opioid abuse prevention and treatment.
From the outset the district attorneys used an aggressive approach and its outside counsel prepared to go to trial taking 50 to 60 depositions causing Endo to refuse to cooperate according to Sullivan County District Attorney Barry Staubus.
And I dont think the attorney general I dont think their offices mindset was the same Staubus says.
Dubbed Sullivan Baby Doe for a child born addicted to opioids the 2.4 billion lawsuits outcome netted proceeds for the babys care and 21 million for nine counties in Northeast Tennessee after Sullivan County Chancellor E.G. Moody found Endo egregiously refused to share information necessary for the plaintiffs to prepare for trial.
In comparison the entire state of Tennessee could get an estimated 7.1 million to 11.7 million  depending on when its paid  from the most recent national settlement with Endo negotiated by the Tennessee Attorney Generals Office which led 30 states and the District of Columbia in reaching the deal.
A group of district attorneys general in Northeast Tennessee partnered with the Nashville law firm of Branstetter Stranch  Jennings to pursue a lawsuit against opioid manufacturers despite opposition to their suit from Attorney General Herbert Slatery  and won 35 million.
With Endo filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy the amount could be further muddied and ultimately part of the final award would go to the state government potentially leaving even less for counties and cities in East and Middle Tennessee to divvy up for opioid addiction treatment or services.
According to a default judgment ordered by Moody the plaintiffs introduced enough expert testimony to support their 2.4 billion claim for damages against the drug maker which it proved knew too many opioids were flooding the market. Endos own records show that 75 of abuse of a reformulated type of Opana ER that some people were injecting took place in Tennessee as the company aggressively marketed opioids to prescribers according to the document.
But as the group of DAs pursued the case with Nashville-based Branstetter Stranch  Jennings the Attorney Generals Office tried to assert its authority and take them all out of the equation.
According to spokeswoman Samantha Fisher the Attorney Generals Office intervened to defend the constitutionality of the statute which we do whenever statutes are challenged.
She notes the East Tennessee district attorneys pursued the Drug Dealer Liability Act which was a different strategy than the Attorney Generals Office took in its case. Fisher adds that the states case is likely to be dismissed because of the bankruptcy but that the proposed settlement would allow Tennessee and other states and local governments to recover millions for abatement.
Slatery however who left office Wednesday Aug. 31 after his term ended clearly objected to the use of trial attorneys.
In an op-ed published this week in the Memphis Commercial Appeal Slatery wrote that the Tennessee Attorney Generals Office refuses to use private-contingency fee lawyers in opioid cases contending theyve received millions of dollars in legal fees.
He does acknowledge in the op-ed that the state hired outside counsel in a lawsuit against Walgreens but paid it for hourly fees billed at a reduced rate. To use an outside law firm the attorney general must have the governors approval as well as the eyes of the governor secretary of state and attorney general on the fee invoices he wrote.
A spokesperson for Slatery said the Attorney Generals office intervened in the DAs suit to defend the constitutionality of the statute which we do whenever statutes are challenged.
Its not clear whether the philosophy of the Attorney Generals Office will change.
Slaterys replacement Jonathan Skrmetti his chief deputy attorney general from 2018 to 2021 managed 160 attorneys and served as a negotiator in a 26 billion multi-state opioid settlement. Hes been Gov. Bill Lees chief counsel since December 2021.
Skrmetti was on staff through much of the Baby Doe case as Slatery tried to take over the case.
However district attorneys  representing local governments who filed suit against Endo and other major pharmaceutical companies in 2017  argued that their strategy would net more money from industry enabling local governments to provide more services to battle the opioid crisis.
Led by Staubus DAs in Northeast Tennessee fended off the effort by Slatery to scuttle the lawsuit they filed against pharmaceutical giants that led to the 35 million settlement in 2021.
The group of DAs felt they were in the best position to take on the case and win the biggest award according to Staubus money that wouldnt have to go through Nashville and could directly target the regions opioid problem which was substantial.
From 2006 through 2014 more than 416 million pain pills were supplied to the nine-county area in Northeast Tennessee 138.4 million to Sullivan County alone 76.1 million to Washington County and 74.7 million to Hamblen County.
After four years of litigation and bankruptcies by Purdue Pharma and Mallinckrodt PLC  the latter of which manufactures and distributes the opioid Roxycodone  the DAs won a settlement with Endo in Sullivan Baby Doe originally Staubus vs. Purdue.
Once legal fees and the court-sealed amount set aside for Baby Doe were distributed local governments in three Northeast Tennessee received the 21 million much of which they are planning to use to outfit an opioid treatment center at a former state prison in Carter County. The Washington County Commission this week approved using 1.9 million for the facility where people addicted to opioids could seek treatment rehabilitation vocational and job training and help in finding jobs and possibly reconnecting with families. Other funds are going toward drug recovery courts.
Staubus stands by the decision to take on the pharmaceutical industry without the Attorney Generals Office saying they are vindicated by the settlement amounts.
I felt like we could get more money because we were focused. We had a game plan that was far more aggressive and I felt like we had excellent attorneys leading the charge Staubus says.
Staubus and District Attorneys Dan Armstrong and Ken Baldwin from Northeast Tennessee championed the case and led by the Nashville-based law firm obtained the settlement when the chancellor determined that Endo defaulted by not sharing information pertinent for trial.
Endo didnt want to produce documents showing its sales force and managers hedged on the illicit diversion of opioids by pill mills and other prescribers. It finally provided 400000 pages of proof after a court-ordered deadline of Feb. 14 2020 for presenting evidence.
In short the chancellor found Endo in contempt and determined the company lost the case before it could go to trial and the only decision was to set the damages forcing the drug producer to settle.
The district attorneys took the money  much of which went straight to local governments with no strings attached  before Endo could file bankruptcy.
Staubus an appointee of former Gov. Bill Haslam who since won election to the post stops short of criticizing Slatery pointing out only that the Attorney Generals Office felt it had the jurisdiction and was in the best position to lead the litigation and decide where the money would go.
As prosecutors however Staubus says we were in the best position to understand what the drug problem was and what the needs were and we just didnt think we needed to beg Nashville to give us money. And we felt like we could be just as effective in our negotiations or our litigation as they were in obtaining that money.
Staubus also says his fight with Endo wouldnt have been successful without outside counsel because of the complexity and enormity of the case.
Slatery however makes no effort to hide his opposition to the use of private law firms to do battle with the pharmaceutical industry.
He further defended his office in the op-ed noting the state has had 15 to 18 attorneys working on opioid cases since 2016. As a result millions of dollars are coming into an Opioid Abatement Trust Fund to be distributed by an independent council to counties and cities.
In that vein Slatery wanted to wrench the Baby Doe case from the DAs and Branstetter Stranch  Jennings a private-contingency firm. But he might not have been prepared to take on the case at that point. He withdrew a motion to intervene a day after the outside law firm responded.
Gerard Stranch partner with Branstetter Stranch  Jennings says Northeast Tennessee district attorneys won out for a simple reason.
We got a better deal because we worked our case all the way up to trial and if they didnt pay us the money we wanted they were going to have to go through a trial Stranch says. We invited the state in to negotiate with us against Endo and they declined.
Democratic state Sen. Jeff Yarbro a Nashville attorney takes a cautious approach to Slaterys work on global opioid settlements.
Tennessee would have fared better if the Attorney General had coordinated his efforts with the district attorneys and local governments rather than try to control them Yarbro says. Concentrating the negotiation and settlement of thousands of claims in a single person is a high-risk strategy that can lead to settling claims for a fraction of their value and insufficient accountability for wrong-doers.
Genesis of dissent
District attorneys general from 14 districts signed a letter to Slatery in March 2018 declaring their opposition to his efforts to derail their lawsuit part of which was based on their decision to use outside counsel.
We find it troubling that you are taking a position adverse to our goals in this litigation. As we have stated to you many many times before we are hopeful that you would be an asset in our fight against the drug producers who drown our communities in illegal opioids. We are disappointed in your attempts to undermine our litigation the letter states.
In fact Staubus says in hindsight he wishes the DAs had been able to team up with the Attorney Generals Office but that never worked out.
The group of district attorneys also noted they were disappointed the state filed motions to intervene in each of their pending lawsuits and contacted each court to schedule unnecessarily expedited hearings without notifying them or their counsel.
The DAs felt those actions by Slaterys office were calculated to prejudice us in the pending lawsuits and provoke rather than lead to reasonable dialogue.
The limited monies that were received went into state coffers in Nashville not into the hands of the smaller communities bearing the greatest need. The results of this failed effort have been another decade lost to growing opioid-fueled abuse addiction and death.  A letter to Attorney General Herbert Slatery signed by 14 district attorneys general
Furthermore in the pending motions and in your recent communications with our attorneys your office refuses to state why it is seeking to intervene and will not confirm or deny whether the purpose of intervening will be to scuttle our lawsuits without any further discovery into the nature and scope of human devastation and economic toll that the major drug producers pill mills and others have wrought on the communities that we serve the letter states.
In arguing the attorney general was overstepping his authority the district attorneys also said Slaterys claim that they were unauthorized to hire outside counsel was without merit. They pointed out the costs of the lawsuit were borne by the outside law firm not taxpayers.
The district attorneys also contended Slaterys office was not in the best position  to obtain the best possible monetary recovery for communities. It pointed out a 2 billion annual cost of the opioid crisis included 46 million for babies with birth defects and 422.5 million for hospitalizations from opioid abuse.
Damages from the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act are dwarfed by those from the Drug Dealer Liability Act under which the state didnt have authority to file a claim the district attorneys argued. Those included policing prosecutions jails hospital stays rehabilitation centers medical expenses and educational services for those addicted to opioids including babies.
We need those remedies to save our communities not statutory damages put into the state common fund that never make it back to our hometowns the district attorneys letter says.
Furthermore they pointed toward a 2007 settlement by 27 state attorney generals with Purdue Pharma for 19.5 million which netted 400000 in attorney fees for the Tennessee Attorney Generals Office 175750 for the states general fund and only 143750 for consumer education projects to pay for further investigations or litigation at the discretion of the AGs Office.
Tennessee also entered a 10-year agreement requiring Purdue and the state to monitor and enforce suspected diversion of Oxycontin in Tennessee but despite holding the enforcement authority the Attorney Generals Office failed to follow through and Tennessee settled the claims for pennies on the dollar the letter says
The limited monies that were received went into state coffers in Nashville not into the hands of the smaller communities bearing the greatest need the DAs said. The results of this failed effort have been another decade lost to growing opioid-fueled abuse addiction and death.
Pain pills are sending more senior citizens to the hospital in Tennessee according to data that sheds new light on how opioid addiction has spread to the state's aging population.
The rate of hospitalizations for Tennesseans 65 years and older due to painkillers has more than tripled in a decade.
Older adults are being hospitalized for reasons that range from falls and auto accidents after taking pain pills to unintentional overdoses interactions with other medications and weakened kidney or liver functions in aging bodies that fail to metabolize the drug in the same way as younger people.
Beyond pills Treating pain without opioids
Experts say physicians and family members are more likely to overlook addiction in senior citizens  even after opioids require a trip to the hospital.
It's not that easy to believe your grandmother has a drug abuse problem said Dr. Peter Martin a psychiatrist and director of the Vanderbilt Addiction Center.
The biggest problem is that no one in the past was worried about an elderly person becoming an addict Martin said.
But opioids affect the brain no matter how old you are. If a person in their 60s and 70s is running out of their prescription early most physicians are less likely to look on that with suspicion as they might do with a younger person he said. They're thinking 'Oh they probably forgot it somewhere.' 
The U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality data ranks Tennessee No. 6 in the nation for the rates of opioid-related hospital admissions among senior citizens. In 2005 467 out of every 100000 people aged 65 and older spent time in the hospital for opioid-related use. In 2015 that rate shot up to 1505.
Tennessee is grappling with an epidemic that claims more lives than car accidents straining courts jails and hospitals and exhausting the limited treatment options. Tennessee along with Alabama tops the nation in the number of per-person opioid prescriptions with an average of more than two prescriptions written for every man woman and child.
In his Nashville practice gerontologist Dr. Jim Powers addresses the problem where it typically starts  in the exam room.
The conversations can be awkward when patients have regularly taken opioids for legitimate pain.
Some patients began taking opioids a decade or more ago when they were in their 40s and 50s and suffered back pain or arthritis at a time when opioids were considered the first line of pain treatment he said. They never stopped.
It's a difficult conversation to have when you're a physician and seeing a new patient Powers said. Most physicians have to negotiate and say 'We'll continue this but let's try other things. Let's get an X-ray.' About 90 percent of physicians will continue opioid prescriptions although they have misgivings.
Powers works with those patients over time to introduce alternatives  physical therapy or spinal injections of cortisone. About a third of his patients are eventually willing to try to stop taking opioids he said.
Other patients need professional help. They need tapering he said. But the system is not ready to receive as many older patients with substance abuse disorder. As the population has grown older we have not seen a corresponding increase in drug treatment programs.
Federal data shows that seniors continue to be more likely to be prescribed opioids.
One-third of seniors enrolled in Medicare Part D prescription coverage filled at least one prescription for an opioid last year  about 14.4 million people according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
More than half a million of those beneficiaries received higher-than-average opioid dosages for at least three months.
Federal and Medicare data doesn't make distinctions between people in their 60s and 70s and those who are in their 80s or 90s.
Experts say it's more likely that baby boomers on the younger end of that spectrum are using  and in some cases abusing  opioids.
There's a definite difference between baby boomers and the generation above them who lived through the Great Depression and are in their 80s and 90s and are much more likely to say 'I don't want to be on a pill'  Powers said.
Baby boomers are also more likely to have experience with drugs and alcohol perhaps making them more likely to turn to pain medications Martin said.
The huge spike in opioid-related hospitalizations left some advocates who work with seniors puzzled.
Could a key to the problem not be opioids themselves but the way they're prescribed to seniors who are known to respond to medications differently
We know that as America grows older there's going to be more hip replacements or more falls but I don't think that counts for a nearly fourfold increase in opioid hospitalizations for this group said Grace Sutherland Smith executive director for the Council on Aging of Middle Tennessee.
We have to ask whether doctors are taking into account how someone over 65 metabolizes medications differently than a young person she said. Whereas you and I might be able to work an older person might become sleepy or numb or incoherent.
Seniors who do seek addiction treatment may face challenges in finding and paying for it.
Medicare covers inpatient detoxification partial hospitalization residential treatment and outpatient individual and group therapy according to information provided by BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee.
It does not cover intensive outpatient treatment or medication-assisted treatment for addiction. The latter can be a key treatment for opioid addicts substituting a maintenance drug that allows people to abstain from opioids.
But there are signs that more older individuals want help.
At a Nashville admissions center for Foundations Recovery Network a nationwide network of treatment facilities for mental health and addiction there was a 55 percent increase in calls from people in the 65-plus age group seeking treatment between January 2015 and January 2017.
Many people assume that addiction is impacting only young people said Lee Pepper chief marketing officer at Foundations Recovery Network. As our population is living longer and aging we are seeing addiction impact our parents and grandparents. Treatment options for elderly Americans become more difficult due to lack of access because of medical complications and mobility.

Tennessee Alabama and South Carolina lead the nation in arresting and criminally punishing women for allegedly posing a danger to their fetuses according to a report released by advocacy group Pregnancy Justice.
Nationwide nearly 1400 people were arrested or subject to disparate bail sentencing and probation for conduct related to their pregnancies between 2005 and the Supreme Court decision in June 2022 dismantling abortion rights the report found. The vast majority were poor white women though poor Black women were disproportionately represented.
Tennessee accounted for 131 of those cases.
Pregnant people have been criminalized at an accelerating rate for actions that would not be illegal but for a persons pregnancy Lourdes Rivera president of Pregnancy Justice told reporters on Tuesday.
The report shows a substantial increase in the number of people being charged for crimes tied to pregnancy. In 2013 Pregnancy Justice released a report that found that law enforcement had targeted 413 pregnant people between 1973  which marked the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion  and 2005. The new findings show those instances have tripled.
When we talk about back alley or secret abortions thats not the real risk to peoples lives.  Nina Gurek Healthy and Free Tennessee
Advocates pointed to two key drivers in criminalizing pregnancy the expansion of so-called fetal rights or personhood laws and a more punitive approach to substance use among pregnant women  even as many states move to decriminalize drug abuse in line with evolving approaches to addiction. The majority of criminal cases documented by Pregnancy Justice related to substance use including marijuana cocaine or methamphetamines. In about one-quarter of these cases the substance was legal such as nicotine alcohol or prescription opiates.
In Tennessee both factors hold true. Tennessee law says that life begins at conception.
Tennessee also became the first state in the nation to enact a fetal assault law. Enacted in 2014 the law allowed women to be prosecuted for drug use during pregnancy. The measure was criticized by state and national health and advocacy groups and was allowed to expire in 2016. Several efforts to reimplement the law have been introduced in the Tennessee Legislature since.
Nina Gurek policy director for Healthy and Free Tennessee said that despite the laws expiration her organization continues to hear of prosecutions involving pregnant women on child abuse or neglect charges involving legal and illegal substance use allegations.
We know its still happening she said.
The Pregnancy Justice report warns that more people could face criminal charges or increased bonds or sentencing as states have enacted abortion bans and restrictions.
Tennessees strict abortion ban explicitly exempts pregnant women from prosecution for seeking abortions.
But Gurek said she places no trust in the laws protections.
When we talk about back alley or secret abortions thats not the real risk to peoples lives said Nina Gurek policy director for Healthy and Free Tennessee. Its handcuffs.
Roughly 50 Nashville bars restaurants and businesses are getting Narcan nasal spray which is a medicine that reverses the effects of a drug overdose.
This is all thanks to a local non-profit and security group teaming up to help save lives.
The opioid crisis is a national epidemic and unfortunately overdoses are on the rise here in Nashville. I was narcanned seven times overdose survivor Rich Johnston said. Johnston says he was addicted to heroin and calls Narcan a miracle drug. I would 100 not be here if it were not for Narcan Johnston emphasized.
Jack Byrd says his teams at Solaren Risk Management a private security group who works with more than 100 downtown businesses partnered with TEMPO which is Gibson's program to offer opioid emergency response kits.
One of the bars receiving these Narcan kits is Dierks Bentleys Whiskey Row on Broadway. Its just like an AED that when you open it up it will start playing a video that tells you how to properly put on PPE to make sure youre safe and everyone else is safe Byrd explained. Byrd says these kits will go up right next to the bars' AEDs.
He says this kit gives step-by-step instruction on how to administer Narcan so this way if someone has training or not they act and respond immediately.
Seconds matter. Absolutely and when you encounter someone experiencing that kind of crisis Byrd said.
Unfortunately its a crisis that Nashvilles bars and restaurants are seeing more of every month.
As a management company on Lower Broadway we have a very close relationship with Metro Nashville Police Department and we know whats going on in Nashville so being a part of this program is our way to help prevent and educate people on this crisis and what we can do to help stop it Lissa Druss with RIOT Hospitality Group said.
This initiative will hopefully help stop people from dying.
I work as an interventionist now and its something that cannot be replaced and the importance of which cannot be overstated Johnston emphasized.
Byrd says by Friday thirty of the downtown bars and restaurants will have these Narcan kits installed right next to their AED and then they will begin the next phase.

Many of us know about opioid addiction through the lives and deaths of members of our families good friends or nearby neighbors. Its personal. And it hurts.
The hurt is growing. The number of fatal opioid overdoses in Tennessee continues to climb increasing from 89 in 2008 to 1304 deaths in 2018. The growth of the opioid epidemic has felt like a runaway train. Fortunately though the pace of the increase in opioid overdoses has started to slow. While this is not a treatment for the pain it does offer hope.
Two state policies helped
The slowing of the opioid death train is quite an accomplishment  and it reflects two key state policies. First the number and dosage of prescriptions for opioids is falling and by a lot. Americans received 247 million opioid prescriptions in 2013 which declined in each successive years to 191 million in 2017. The impact on Tennessee may be even greater after state legislators restricted opioid prescribing beginning in July 2018. The early impact appears promising.

Second state officials empowered all Tennesseans to respond to overdoses. Tennessee legislators voted to make Narcan the first-line overdose reversal agent available without a prescription  and also to provide Narcan through several public programs. The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services continues its invaluable effort to distribute Narcan to community groups across Tennessee and train all of us how to use it. Most emergency first responders now carry and all-too-frequently use Narcan the brand name for the nasal-spray application of naloxone. The Nashville Fire Department for example equipped all fire trucks and ambulances with Narcan two years ago.
Unexpected consequences
These two state policies saved lives. However they had several downstream effects. Many people struggling with addiction moved from prescription opioids to heroin fentanyl or methamphetamine. Thus the proportion of overdoses involving synthetic opioids in Tennessee increased from 39 of all opioid overdoses in 2015 to 58 in 2017. In addition the number of nonfatal overdoses has gone up. Locally the Nashville Fire Department reported treating 2260 residents with Narcan in 2019 a 28 annual increase in just 12 months.
Its not enough to keep people breathing and leave their addiction untreated but sadly treatment options in Tennessee are limited. Waiting lists for all forms of treatment particularly ongoing outpatient treatment are extensive and providers are few. This is deeply concerning as individuals with opioid addiction are more likely to be uninsured and without a clear source of care.
Building on recent successes Tennessee can increase access to treatment. We can expand availability of the recommended first-line treatment known as buprenorphine for those addicted to opioids. The experience nationally is positive with every other state now allowing nurse practitioners to prescribe buprenorphine. Tennessee legislators must follow suit and change state law by passing SB 1060. With the stroke of a pen we can make treatment much more widely accessible to those who need it. Many of us are waiting to increase that accessibility. Tennessee has numerous community health centers like ours at Neighborhood Health that provide care to those who need it regardless of their insurance status or ability to pay.
Im optimistic we can do this. We can do more than restore breath during an overdose we can provide life. As a pharmacist mother and grandmother its what I want for my family. Im sure its what Tennessee legislators want for theirs.

NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  2388 people died from an opioid overdose in Tennessee in 2020 the last year the Department of Health has numbers available.
Now Tennessee is working to fight the opioid crisis with new funding for treatment programs and prevention.
Nearly 81 million will be given to organizations across the state to combat the opioid epidemic.
In Nashville Meharry Medical College is one of them receiving more than 2 million for four programs. Metro government Nashville CARES and Interfaith Dental Clinic of Nashville are also on the list for grants.
In all Tennessee's Opioid Abatement Council approved of 116 grants to go towards six areas
Treatment Recovery and Support Primary Prevention Education and Training Harm Reduction and Research and Evaluation.
This is the first time the committee is releasing community grants like this.
The funding comes from settlements the state has made with opioid producers distributors pharmacies and marketers that was put into the The Opioid Abatement Trust Fund.
Now the wrongs of those companies will turn into positive action for the people who need it most.
Seeing money going into the community is as exciting as it gets for me said Dr. Stephen Loyd chairman of the Opioid Abatement Council. The system of care we're putting in now is what will serve Tennesseans for the next two or three decades. So that is the dream. No matter where you touch this you get the care that's right for you.
The programs funded by these grants will be supported for up to three years.

Xylazine has been found in fentanyl heroin and other drugs according to a November notice from the Food and Drug Administration. It appears Naloxone which is administered in an effort to reverse the overdose effects of opioids may not have an impact on Xylazine according to the FDA.
Xylazine is making the deadliest drug threat our country has every faced fentanyl even deadlier DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said. DEA has seized xylazine and fentanyl mixtures in 48 of 50 States. The DEA Laboratory System is reporting that in 2022 approximately 23 of fentanyl powder and 7 of fentanyl pills seized by the DEA contained xylazine.
Evidence of the drug in Tennessee has nearly doubled each year for the last two years though Xylazine does not show up on a standard toxicology screen so cases could be underreported according to the FDA.
From 2020 to 2021 overdose deaths across Tennessee where Xylazine was present increased from 56 to 94 according to a report published by the Tennessee Department of Health in November.
At the time Davidson County was third in the state for deaths behind Shelby and Knox counties.
Since then the drug has been classified as an emerging substance in Nashville according to quarterly reports published by the Metro Public Health Department.
Xylazine has been increasingly detected among suspected overdose deaths during the last two years according to the last quarter's report.
The department first included Xylazine in their 2021 fourth quarter report where it was found in 2.7 of overdose deaths about 20 cases. In 2020 about 8 cases 1.3 of overdose deaths included the drug.
Last year nearly 40 overdose cases involved Xylazine.
NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  So far in 2023 there have been 2864 suspected overdoses in Nashville 217 were deadly. Now a new program is putting lifesaving materials in the hands of those who need it.
The Leave Behind program is a partnership between the Metro Nashville Police Department Metro Nashville Fire Department and STARS or Students Taking A Right Stand.
We are in our very early stages of trying this out in Davidson County said Andrea Hancock Regional Overdose Prevention Specialist with STARS.
As part of the program first responders receive training and overdose reversal kits that they leave behind after responding to an overdose call. The kits include fentanyl test strips sterile gloves Kloxxado a nasal spray that's double the dosage of Naloxone and information on how to find treatment.
It gives the first responders an opportunity also to make a connection and to show that 'hey we're here to help' said Hancock.
Sergeant Michael Hotz with the MNPD Neighborhood Safety Unit said his officers have already distributed between 25 to 35 kits.
A lot of what we do in our unit is outreach and harm reduction said Hotz. We try and put people in touch with treatment resources if they're suffering from substance use disorder.
He said the kits are for those who are at high risk of an opioid overdose or who have recently suffered an overdose.
Just last week Hotz responded to a deadly overdose. There were three individuals left at the scene and we provided them each with kits which not only gives them the lifesaving drug of Naloxone but it also provides them with resources for treatment he said.
Hotz hopes the more kits his officers leave behind the more people will look for treatment.
If we really want to make a difference in this opioid epidemic we need to put people in touch with treatment resources and treat addiction for the disease that it is.
The program is funded by a state overdose response grant through the Tennessee Department of Mental Health  Substance Abuse.
If youre struggling with addiction The Tennessee REDLINE is the 247365 resource for substance abuse treatment referrals.
Anyone can call or text 800-889-9789 for confidential referrals.

Drug overdose deaths continued to rise throughout Tennessee last year primarily because of a dramatic spike in deaths attributed to fentanyl an exceptionally powerful opioid for which a lethal dose is no larger than two grains of sand.
In total 1776 Tennesseans died in drug overdoses in 2017 up from 1631 the prior year according to a Monday announcement from the Tennessee Department of Health. This is at least the sixth year in a row that the death toll has risen.
More Tennesseans died last year from drug overdoses than from automobile crashes said Health Commissioner John Dreyzehner in a news release announcing the overdose death toll. Few of us have escaped a direct impact of this crisis in experiencing the tragic death of a family member loved one or friend.
Prescription opioids like hydrocodone and oxycodone remain the most common cause of overdoses  associated with 644 deaths  according to the new statistics. But the death toll was boosted by a second year of skyrocketing deaths attributed to fentanyl a synthetic opioid that was largely unknown only a few years ago. Fentanyl deaths rose 74 percent in 2016 killing 294 then another 70 percent in 2017 killing 500.
The spike mirrors what has been previously reported in Nashville where city data showed fentanyl deaths surpassed heroin deaths for the first time in 2017. Experts said this represented a deepening of the opioid crisis with more addicts transitioning from prescription pills to street drugs which are sometimes laced with fentanyl.
Fentanyl is similar to heroin but cheaper to make and 50 times stronger so drug dealers mix it into their product to maximize profits. This causes overdoses because addicts believe they are using heroin but are actually injecting much more potent fentanyl.
OPIOIDSFor years it was illegal to give out clean needles in Nashville. They did it anyway.
Fentanyl has also been found laced into cocaine and in fake prescription medications which are made with black market pill presses and sold to unknowing victims on the street.
You cant know what youre getting when you buy drugs on the street and that makes them extremely dangerous said Dr. David Ragon chief medical officer for the state health department in the news release. We are alarmed by the growing number of Tennesseans dying from drug overdoses especially involving fentanyl. We must place additional focus on prevention of substance abuse.
In a statement announcing the overdose deaths TBI Director David Rausch said his agency would remain committed to disrupting the supply of fentanyl and other drugs. The new overdose statistics he said were further proof that the danger of Tennessees opioid epidemic is real immediate and continuing to grow.
Dreyzhner the state health commissioner said the new overdose deaths underscore the need for reasonable limits on prescription medication and additional treatment resources for addicts.
The good news is this has spurred us collectively to more action than ever before and while prescription drugs still account for the majority of deaths there is new hope on the horizon in many areas he said. Prevention works stigma is decreasing treatment is effective and people get better.
OPIOIDSFor years heroin has been the deadliest drug in Nashville. Not anymore.

NASHVILLE Tenn.--The Tennessee Board of Judicial Conduct is calling on the State Legislature to remove a local judge from her post due to alleged substance abuse issues and a failure to comply with terms of her previous suspensions.
In a  the recommendation by the board centers around Judge A. Melissa Boyd who serves as a Criminal Court Judge in the 30th Judicial District in Shelby County.
According to the recommendation Judge Boyd has received two public reprimands since taking the role in September 2022. One reprimand cited from May 8 2023 states within weeks of Judge Boyd assuming office she solicited resources and cash donations on social media for the benefit of a third party. Judge Boyd is said to have ignored the Board's inquiry into the matter but agreed to accept the reprimand.
On May 22 2023 Judge Boyd was suspended following allegations from a campaign manager who also had personal relations with the judge. According to affidavits filed by the former campaign manager the woman claims she discovered a plate with a spoon and what is believed to have been cocaine in the Judge's home closet. The affidavit states Judge Boyd admitted it was cocaine to the campaign manager and also admitted to smoking marijuana multiple times since being elected.
The affidavits go on to allege Judge Boyd was also seen outside the campaign manager's property in January 2023 taking pictures of the woman's car and property which she then texted to the woman. The affidavit stated Judge Boyd allegedly sent more texts asking who is the whore seriously Judge Body also allegedly sent the woman pictures of her prior marriage license and information about her divorce which made the woman feel disturbed.
The Board memo adds following the suspensions the Board gave Judge Boyd an opportunity to resign in November of last year but did not respond nor had she addressed substance abuse issues. In December of last year Judge Boyd was indicted on charges of coercion of a witness and harassment. Judge Boyd responded she had ultimately entered a rehab facility after the specified required dates and accused the Board of piling on her by keeping her off the bench.

In a bid to combat the opioid crisis riddling Tennessee the Opioid Abatement Council has announced the release of a hefty 80.9 million in community grants. These funds earmarked for a variety of programs designed to address opioid addiction will support the states efforts for up to a stretch of three years. During a meeting in Farragut on March 18 the council approved 116 grants from a pool of 396 proposals submitted last fall according to an announcement on the state's official website.
The substantial sum is divided into six strategies aimed at attacking the problem from different angles Treatment programs receive the lion's share with over 32.7 million followed by Recovery Support and Primary Prevention earmarked at 18.9 million and 12.2 million respectively. Education and Training got over 8.1 million absolutely needed Harm Reduction initiatives were allocated 8 million and Research and Evaluation efforts were granted a modest 752508. A wide range of initiatives the 116 projects were developed by 85 different awardees 30 of which target statewide issues and roughly 5.7 million designated for capital projects.
Dr. Stephen Loyd Opioid Abatement Council Chairman reflected deeply on the milestone and its significance When the history of the opioid crisis in our state is written people will look back at this date as a landmark on the road to healing the unbelievable harm done to so many families and communities. He added At every meeting we pause to 'remember our why' and I can say that the level of thought and care put into this process truly honors the 'why' for all of our members and the countless families that have been touched by opioid addiction in Tennessee.
The genesis of these grants lies in the hard-fought settlements obtained from the pockets of opioid producers distributors pharmacies and marketers as pursued by the Tennessee Attorney General. Funds flow into the Opioid Abatement Trust Fund with local governments getting a 15 slice the state government another 15 and a comfortable 70 channeled into the fund. The community grants benefiting from a 65 share of the fund are disbursed by the council while the counties receive the remaining 35 for opioid remediation activities. Prior funding to county governments amounted to 31.4 million released around a year ago.
Tennessee's Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti proudly acknowledged the commitment behind this financial offensive against the epidemic saying This office has worked hard for years to obtain money for Tennessees Opioid Abatement Trust Fund by holding companies accountable for their opioid-related misconduct. He continued We are gratified to see that money put to good use by the Council and the grant recipients. We have ensured that settlement money will flow into the trust fund for years to come and we thank the Opioid Abatement Council and its chairman Dr. Stephen Loyd for their wise stewardship of these hard-earned dollars.
Emphasizing the collaborative nature of the undertaking Mary Shelton Executive Director of the Opioid Abatement Council highlighted the extensive efforts leading up to the grant release. Its been such a collaborative effort to get to where we are today. From the hard work and long hours of our council members and council staff to the guidance and support from the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services and Tennessee Attorney Generals Office there are so many dedicated public servants who have contributed greatly. And now as we release this funding to grantees the focus turns to ensuring that every dollar makes a difference she stated.
5 deaths linked to heroin in Nash County
NASHVILLE NC WTVD -- Nash County Sheriff Keith Stone says five people have died of heroin overdoses in the past week.
It's an ongoing problem. Stone told the Wilson Times that he's seeing EMS workers called out at least three times a week for overdoses and some die.
He explained that prescription drug addiction leads to snorting heroin which leads to injecting heroin. Overdoses happen frequently with injecting.
Stone is doing what he can. In 2015 there were 50 arrests in the county related to heroin.
Heroin is killing people - good people Stone told the Times. It not only destroys the person who uses it it affects everybody they are in contact with like their families.

Last year was the deadliest ever for drug overdoses in Tennessee.
The CDC tallied 1837 confirmed deaths plus 89 estimated more deaths.
Deaths dropped in neighboring states that were hit hard by the opioid crisis.
Last year was the deadliest ever for drug deaths in Tennessee and while most of the nation appears to have gained ground on the opioid crisis the Volunteer State has not.
According to new statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at least 1837 people died of drug overdoses in Tennessee in 2018. The CDC estimates that an additional 89 people also died of drug overdoses but those deaths remain unconfirmed by toxicology tests.
Even excluding the estimated deaths the 2018 death toll is an increase of 3 over 2017 which was previously the deadliest year on record.
The CDC data released this week does not reveal what drugs caused each overdose but state experts believe Tennessees increase is largely attributable to rising fentanyl and methamphetamine deaths. State epidemiologist Dr. Tim Jones said the state had made significant progress cutting down on prescription opioid abuse but these gains had been outweighed by fentanyl and meth overdoses.
We were once close to the top of the pile in terms of prescription opioid use abuse and therefore deaths Jones said. Unfortunately as weve decreased opioid prescriptions there are still people who are really dependent and it can drive to heroin fentanyl and other drugs.
SMUGGLINGAs cartel drugs flood Tennessee meth and cocaine deaths are climbing
But that doesnt explain why Tennessee is an outlier in a nation that appears to be gaining ground on the opioid crisis. The CDC reports that nationwide overdoses fell more than 4 in 2018. Overdose deaths dropped more dramatically in other Appalachian states that were among those hit hardest by the epidemic  including Ohio Pennsylvania West Virginia and Kentucky.
Jones said it was unclear why neighboring states had turned a corner when Tennessee had not. Within the Department of Health it remains a frustrating mystery he said.
We will take any good ideas from anywhere as to how to help stop this Jones said.
DRUG DEATHSCocaine heroin increasingly laced with deadly fentanyl drug tests reveal
The new CDC data was also very concerning to Dr. Howard Taylor lab director for American Addiction Centers in Brentwood which tests drug samples collected nationwide. Taylor said one of the strongest indicators for overdose deaths was the availability and quality of addiction treatment so he questioned if shortcomings in treatment were holding Tennessee back.
My concern is that Tennessee is falling behind our neighbors and the rest of the country in terms of what we are offering people for treatment Taylor said.

NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  Substance abuse and mental health issues are becoming increasingly prevalent across the United States.
According to the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services TDMHSAS this is also an issue in the state of Tennessee with the annual number of fatal drug overdoses in Davidson County steadily increasing over the last seven years.
In response to these challenges TDMHSAS has established a Faith-Based Initiative to certify congregations and bring mental health and substance abuse resources to their communities.
This program is particularly important for communities of color where discussing these topics can be difficult due to the stigma surrounding mental health and addiction.
For Pastor Cornelius Hill of Ephesians Primitive Baptist Church the need for these resources became all too real when his choir director took her own life.
He recognized that his church community needed to do better in supporting members facing mental health and substance abuse issues. It's why he signed his congregation to be apart of the initiative.
The TDMHSAS Faith-Based Initiative has been certifying congregations since 2014 and recently celebrated its 1000th recovery congregation.
To become certified faith leaders must attend free training to learn more about the mental health and addiction challenges faced by their communities. The training covers a range of topics including the brain science of addiction an introduction to common mental health conditions and suicide prevention.
In addition to certifying congregations the TDMHSAS Faith-Based Community Coordinators have held about 1800 free educational events to provide education and break down the stigma of addiction. These resources are critical in helping churches bring valuable resources to their congregations and their communities.
For Pastor Hill the program is not just about providing resources but also about removing the stigma surrounding mental health and addiction. We're removing the stigma. Removing the shame. Restoring the soul. People can come to church not knowing how but knowing there is help he said.
As the TDMHSAS Faith-Based Initiative continues to expand its reach more churches are becoming involved in providing support to those struggling with mental health and substance abuse issues.

Nick Salazar didnt think he was an addict because he didnt live on urban city streets.
He lived instead in his parents house in suburban New Jersey.
I thought I have a job so Im OK. Im not homeless so Im OK  recalled Salazar.
He didnt think he was an addict because he took prescription pills not heroin.
Then one day he took heroin because he was short on the cash to buy pills.
It was only going to be a one-time fix and then he would go back to pills  because that was better somehow.
But it wasnt for one day. Heroin was cheaper.
I thought Im not shooting it. I snort it or smoke it. Again that told me I wasnt a drug addict he said.
I had this idea I grew up in this upper-middle class suburb in New Jersey. I grew up with this idea of what an addict was and where an addict was and that did not fit with what I saw in my town.
Addicts are in almost every town in Tennessee and the U.S. At least 1263 people died from overdose in the state in 2014.
Yet it wasnt until Salazar now 26 moved from Summit N.J. to Nashville to get help at Cumberland Heights that he realized he wasnt alone and that an addict can be anyone anywhere.
Overdose deaths reach 'epidemic proportions'
What Ive seen more and more talking to my friends is addicts are everywhere he said. Opiates and heroin are everywhere.
Salazar has been clean for three-and-a-half years. He made a group of friends most of whom are recovering from substance abuse and decided to stay in Nashville.
He married this summer and expects to graduate from Belmont University in three semesters. Hes passionate about substance abuse and helps others who are in rehab.
There are people all across the state with experiences such as his.
He started with Vicodin and Percocet from people who had wisdom teeth removed or were being treated for sports injuries.
Article continues below photo.
Then he moved to Oxycontin. At his peak of tolerance he spent about 200 a day to get his fix.
Heroin  used in the late 19th century as a cough suppressant and ironically as a treatment to opioid addiction  was next.
I had this idea this stigma in my mind about using it it was a line I didnt want to cross Salazar said. I had in my mind that pills were somehow safe and better because they were from a doctor not my doctor but a doctor.
Heroin was a step too far until it wasn't. He spent about 100 a day at his peak of heroin use.
The addiction took over his life. He woke up thinking about his next fix.
It became more important to me than anything else Salazar said.
He tried to get clean. Sometimes he took less. He never had a close call with an overdose but he felt resigned to his life and at times almost wanted to take too much.
Now he wants to write and direct TV shows and movies. He thinks about recovery every day but not the drugs and addiction.
In the early days of treatment using was an obsession.
Recovery is something I work on every day he said. I really wanted to get clean more than I wanted to get high so I did things to treat that disease.

NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  The opioid crisis continues to affect communities across the country and researchers are saying its impact has reached new levels.
The use of fentanyl together with stimulants like cocaine and meth is driving what they're calling the Fourth Wave.
The first wave began because of the rise in prescription opioids starting in the early 2000s the second by heroin's rise starting around 2010 and the third fentanyl around 2013.
Now the fourth has become known as more people are mixing together fentanyl with other stimulants knowingly and unknowingly.
The overdose epidemic has taken a heartbreaking toll on Nashville with just one other city in the country having a higher overdose death rate.
Davidson county's total last year 754 deaths made Nashville the second worst place in the country for overdose deaths. Fentanyl was detected in more than 77 percent of the cases.
As of this year 332 people died of an overdose in Nashville in the first half of this year. The county's overdose death count has gotten higher every year since 2016 however If the trend continues this year the numbers may be lower than 2022.
Researchers said understanding how people use drugs is crucial to stopping the overdose crisis and helping people get treatment. Treatments like Narcan are now available over the counter to offer immediate help.
With the death toll rising and the flow of opiates from Big Pharma unabated state prosecutors and the Tennessee Attorney Generals office are locked in a legal battle for power and money.
Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery III is challenging the legal authority of 14 state district attorneys general to sue Big Pharma and its partners in the opiate supply chain and insisting they had no right to engage a private law firm.
The DAs  representing 47 counties in Middle and East Tennessee - contend Slatery sat idly by as the opioid epidemic decimated their communities so they took matters into their own hands under state laws they say give them the right to hire a law firm and mount their own legal fight against Big Pharma and its partners.
MoreHard-won compromise likely means limits for first-time opioid prescriptions in Tennessee
Nashville law firm Branstetter Stranch and Jennings last year filed lawsuits in several state courts including circuit courts in Campbell and Sullivan counties on behalf of state prosecutors in judicial districts throughout East and Middle Tennessee against Big Pharma and its partners including distributors.
Slaterys office earlier this week filed motions to intervene in those cases  nine months after the first such lawsuit was filed.
Legal documents and letters obtained by USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee show the two sides arent just warring over authority. Money  who gets it and where it goes  is also at the root of the disagreement on how best to hold Big Pharma and its partners legally and financially accountable for the opioid epidemic.
In depthThe science behind the Tennessee opioid crisis
InvestigationHow many lives are lost to opioids No one knows.
Slaterys office has repeatedly said it was investigating the possibility of suing Big Pharma but has yet to do so. But Slatery was recently tapped to lead a committee of attorneys general across the nation formed at the direction of a federal judge in Ohio who is pushing for a fast settlement with Big Pharma.
Is 'global settlement' a money grab
He argued in a letter to the DAs that he was much better positioned than they to get the state a share of that money and their lawsuits were interfering with the possibility of what he termed a global settlement.
My office has devoted significant resources to this issue and is leading a coalition of approximately 40 states actively investigating opioid manufacturers and distributors.  we have the ability to seek relief for the state and its political subdivisions through a global resolution. Your litigation complicates that effort.
MoreScott Campbell counties hop on board Big Pharma racketeering lawsuit train
The DAs fired back that local communities  not the state  have borne the costs of the opioid epidemic and local communities should be afforded the lions share of any damages that might result from Big Pharma litigation. Slaterys proposed global settlement they argue is a money grab for state coffers.
We know the idea of rolling up various opioid-related lawsuits into one settlement can seem appealing especially when Big Pharma is already pleading poverty - despite billions in revenue generated at the expense of our citizens a letter on behalf of the DAs read. That said we also know that in these situations local communities lose out.
They noted the state attorney generals office  under Slaterys predecessor  was part of a 2007 settlement with Purdue Pharma the manufacturer of widely abused opioid OxyContin.
In that case Tennessee received roughly 720000 of the 19.5 million settlement. Of that money 400000 went to cover attorneys fees for the attorney general according to the district attorneys.
The DAs also pointed out the attorney generals office had authority under that settlement to force Big Pharma and its partners to reveal when communities received shipments of more opiates than population but did nothing.
The terms of the settlement went unenforced and Tennessee settled its claims for pennies on the dollar the DAs letter stated. The limited monies that were received went into state coffers in Nashville not into the hands of the smaller communities bearing the greatest need.
The results of this failed effort have been another decade lost to growing opioid-fueled abuse addiction and death the letter stated. Our local communities have been devastated in this wake and we cannot and we must not fail again.
Lying about opiates' addictive properties
There are two sets of tracks being laid across the nation in what is shaping up to be a Big Tobacco-style legal fight to force Big Pharma to cough up money for the addiction its wares have wrought. Like Big Tobacco Big Pharma and its partners are accused of lying about the addictive properties of opiates.
The DAs are opting for state court action and are using state laws they argue give them specific authority to do so including the Drug Dealer Liability Act.
Others including the county commissions of Campbell and Scott counties are using racketeering laws and federal court where U.S. District Judge Dan Aaron Polster of Ohio has already been tapped to try to marshal whats known as a multidistrict litigation or MDL.
He is urging a speedy tough settlement of the more than 200 lawsuits that have been filed on behalf of local governments and hospitals and other groups across the nation in the past two years. Slatery has been participating in conferences helmed by Polster.
Jonathan Taylor with the Knoxville firm Taylor  Knight and Nashville firm Lieff Cabraser Heimann  Bernstein have filed MDL actions against Big Pharma on behalf of several East and Middle Tennessee county governments. Like the DAs county governments also are trying to ensure any money reaped from Big Pharma goes back to local communities Taylor said.
A number of county commissions that we represent in Tennessee have recognized their responsibilities to taxpayers and have understood the urgency of bringing these lawsuits now Taylor said.
Slatery has not filed any challenges to those MDL cases. In response to questions from USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee on Wednesday Slatery's office pointed to an opinion column Slatery recently wrote.
In that column Slatery made clear he is backing the MDL settlement effort.
We believe the best course of action is the one we are taking - a multi-state investigation that focuses on preparing for litigation with the possibility of a comprehensive settlement Slatery wrote.
A war with AG's office
Stephen Crump who serves as district attorney general for the 10th Judicial District in Southeast Tennessee said he and his fellow DAs dont want a war with Slaterys office but feel compelled to act.
I think its a shame in a war that ought to be us against them its started out as us against us Crump said. We have acted as they sat. We hope that they will join us in this but we will not go away. The only group that benefits from their actions would be the opioid manufacturers. Its certainly not Tennesseans.
Jared Effler a district attorney general whose district includes Campbell and Claiborne counties pointed on Wednesday to the 2007 settlement as proof he and his fellow DAs were right to file suit.
That settlement failed to provide any resources to our rural communities and has allowed the opioid epidemic to explode he said. For me to sit by and allow the failures of the AG'S 2007 settlement to repeat themselves would be a dereliction of my duties to the citizens of the 8th Judicial District.
Campbell County currently ranks third in the nation for the number of opiate prescriptions as a percentage of population with a rate of 195 prescriptions for every 100 citizens. Claiborne County ranks seventh.
Hearings on the motion to intervene filed by Slaterys office have not yet been set.
Tennessee's Opioid Abatement Council is releasing its first community grants totaling nearly 81 million to programs treating opioid addiction.
The council approved 116 grants to 85 entities across the state at a meeting on Monday. The money comes from settlements with opioid producers distributors pharmacies and marketers litigated by the Tennessee Attorney General.
When the history of the opioid crisis in our state is written people will look back at this date as a landmark on the road to healing the unbelievable harm done to so many families and communities Opioid Abatement Council Chairman Stephen Loyd said in a news release.
The recipients include several Middle Tennessee organizations governments and universities including 2.1 million to the Metro Nashville government for an Opioid Care System Project.
Other Middle Tennessee recipients include 2.9 million to Belmont University for a mobile clinic and training program 2.6 million to Meharry Medical College for various projects 441268 to Antioch ministry Men of Valor for recovery support for formerly incarcerated people 4.1 million to Middle Tennessee State University for various projects 495000 to Nashville CARES for its Drug Awareness Response Team 2.9 million to Vanderbilt University Medical Center for various projects as well as many others. The full list of recipients is here.
Among the selected programs 32.8 million will go to toward treatment 19 million will go toward recovery support 12.2 million will go toward primary prevention 8.2 million will go toward education and training 8.1 million will go toward harm reduction and 750000 will go toward research and evaluation values are approximate.
We are gratified to see that money put to good use by the Council and the grant recipients Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said in the news release. We have ensured that settlement money will flow into the trust fund for years to come and we thank the Opioid Abatement Council and its chairman Dr. Stephen Loyd for their wise stewardship of these hard-earned dollars.
The Tennessee General Assembly established the Opioid Abatement Council in 2021 to decide how to distribute money received from lawsuits related to the opioid crisis.
Settlement funds are first split with 15 going to county governments and 15 going to state government while the remaining 70 goes to the Opioid Abatement Trust Fund. Thirty-five percent of the fund goes to county governments while the remaining  what was released in this round of grants  goes to community groups.
The council released 31.4 million to county governments for opioid abatement in February 2023.

U.S. drug overdose deaths in 2020 eclipsed all records in recorded history according to the Centers for Disease Control.
More than 81000 people died last year nationwide  a 34 increase from 2019  primarily from overdosing on synthetic opioids.
In Tennessee the latest available figure is 2089 overdose deaths in 2019  15 above 2018 and an all-time high per the Tennessee Department of Health.
While COVID-19 dominated headlines the opioid epidemic still rages and is worsening. However there are concerted efforts to assist people addicted to drugs to heal and to help them return to normal life.
Among them are the 21st District Recovery Court that serves Hickman Lewis Perry and Williamson counties.
Jeff Moseley board president of 21st District Recovery Court is my guest on this episode of the Tennessee Voices podcast and we discussed how the drug court works and how people of all socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds suffer from the disease of addiction.
The court's work was especially tough during the strictest of COVID restrictions when support groups could not meet in person.
However recovery meetings switched to video conferencing and the work continued to help clients as best as possible avoid falling into further distress and legal trouble.
The 21st District Court reports that 65 to 70 of drug court graduates remain arrest-free.

A once niche veterinary sedative typically used to tranquilize horses is contributing to a growing public health challenge in Tennessee and beyond as xylazine nicknamed the zombie drug infiltrates the opioid epidemic. As reported by The Tennessean the misuse of xylazine which can bring about grave skin infections in human users has notably increased in conjunction with overdose deaths a disturbing trend that saw the drug gaining traction initially in the eastern part of Tennessee and now across the state.
Initially cleared for animal use by the FDA in the 1970s the reappearance of xylazine as an additive to potent opioids such as fentanyl has been alarming the U.S. News  World Report highlights CDC findings that show an astronomical rise in xylazine-involved overdose deaths from 102 incidents in 2018 to a staggering 3468 by 2021 these statistics reflect not just a casual uptick in use but an exponential surge that is exceedingly concerning.
Amplifying the gravity of the situation CDC research presented by U.S. News  World Report revealed that xylazine was present in nearly 11 of all fatal fentanyl overdoses by June 2022 which is almost quadruple the percentage from January 2019. The presence of xylazine aggravates the risk of overdose as well as causes severe skin ulcers a factor that complicates the already dire opioid crisis.
The infiltration of xylazine into the illicit drug market necessitates a keen public health response something social service and health care providers in Tennessee are engaged in as they formulate strategies to combat the drug's hazardous infiltration which is despite warnings from the FDA about the dire consequences of human exposure to the substance these warning that unfortunately appear to have fallen short of stemming the tide of xylazine abuse as evidenced by data shared by Knox News on X. Efforts to raise awareness and enhance treatment protocols are underway meeting an urgent need in the health crisis fueled by tainted opioids.
In 2015 state officials reported at least 1451 men women and children died from drug overdoses in Tennessee - but that's far from an accurate count.
There are likely hundreds more. No one knows the true number.
Drug deaths reported in Tennessee are fundamentally flawed and represent an under-count of the toll taken by opioids the nations most deadly drug epidemic a USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee investigation found.

There are so many levels at which the data breaks down that we dont know what we dont know said Dr. Adele Lewis deputy state chief medical examiner.
There is no doubt we are under-counting them overdose deaths. There is no way that number is reality.'
A long-standing problem
The opioid overdose crisis is highlighting a longstanding problem of unreliable death investigations that is particularly acute in rural areas that do not have trained forensic pathologists  the same areas where opioids have taken the largest toll.
Without an accurate count lawmakers public health officials and law enforcement have no way of knowing the extent of the problem and how to combat it.
The investigation found that the states 95 county medical examiners who lack training in forensic medicine and are paid very little or work for free take different approaches to investigating and recording causes of death.

In rural Unicoi County for example the coroner heads to the scene of every suspicious drug death searching for pill bottles and interviewing relatives. Unicoi's coroner Ed Herndon believes state law requires him to order autopsies on every suspected overdose death. It doesnt  although autopsies are strongly recommended.
In contrast Campbell Countys longtime medical examiner Dr. E.G. Cline relies on a phone call from local police to describe a death scene. He rarely orders autopsies or toxicology tests that would determine all of the drugs in a person's body to include on a death certificate because he says the only point of the death certificate is to declare the person dead.
Death certificates are the single critical source of information on causes of death.
Money also plays a factor in undercounting overdose deaths.
Autopsies are the most accurate way of determining whether someone died from an overdose.
But they are expensive costing most counties between 1600 and 2000. Many of the county examiners who spoke to USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee echoed Dr. Tom Thompson the medical examiner in Hamblen County If we autopsied every overdose the county would go broke.
Medical examiners are only one link in a chain of individuals who are responsible for identifying overdose deaths.
Before medical examiners get involved in a death they must get a call from police or hospitals to flag a suspicious death that requires an investigation.
Those deaths can go unreported when a person succumbs to a heart attack pneumonia or other illnesses that result from prescription drug abuse. Those deaths should be recorded as opioid-related  but often get categorized as natural.

When medical examiners do order autopsies a body is sent to one of the states five forensic centers where trained forensic pathologists perform them.
The five centers send bodily fluids for testing to three different privately-owned toxicology labs which each test for a different panel of drugs.
A growing national concern
Tennessee is not alone. A working group convened by the White House in 2016 released a report in December noting more than 50 federal programs rely on often-faulty cause-of-death data to create policy.
The group called for strengthening of the nation's fragmented system for investigating deaths noting the need has become increasingly urgent given the sharp rise in deaths involving prescription medication and illicit drugs.
Many parts of the country are experiencing deaths in epidemic proportions as a result of the opioid and heroin crisis while mortality data to inform government policy and programmatic response remains inadequate the report said.

In Tennessee the problem is exacerbated by paper records instead of an electronic death registration system that would prompt medical examiners to enter more detailed information. Lewis said state officials hope to have one by next year. Tennessee is one of the few states that lacks one.
Medical examiners take inconsistent approaches
Dr. Scott Portis serves as medical examiner for Benton County and assistant medical examiner for neighboring Henry County. At 76 he hoped to retire to his cabin on Kentucky Lake years ago but there is no one to take his place.
I tried to quit but the mayor said 'I don't know who would take this on' said Portis a former emergency room director and family practitioner.
By state law all medical examiners must be physicians. Most are family practitioners - whose full time job is taking care of live people  not heading out to crime scenes or interpreting toxicology reports. Most are paid very little for the extra duties. In Lewis County Sen. Joey Hensley volunteers as medical examiner in addition to his job as state lawmaker and local physician.
In two counties long-serving coroners without medical degrees were allowed to retain their positions when state rules changed.
In the state's largest cities medical examiners are full-time forensic pathologists who perform autopsies and have a staff of professional death investigators who visit each suspicious death scene.
But in the majority of Tennessee's 95 mostly-rural counties medical examiners are local doctors given little training beyond a handbook of rules and guidelines to follow.
Portis estimates that 30 to 40 percent of deaths in Benton County are drug overdoses. To determine cause of death he sends bodily fluids to a lab in Nashville for toxicology tests. To help save the county money Portis said he consciously reduced the number of autopsies. Before he was medical examiner the county was paying for 30 or 40 autopsies a year. So far this year he has ordered just four.
If we think they overdosed there's no sense in ordering an autopsy because it will cost us 2000 and the toxicology report is 200-400 Portis said. It would break the county if we got an autopsy on every drug overdose. We are very prudent in spending the county's money.
Autopsies are the most effective way of determining cause of death according to Lewis. They are recommended for every suspected overdose death in Tennessee but not required.
A Knox County report on drug deaths last year noted that while the number of autopsies increased by 25 percent over six years the number of known drug-related cases had doubled.
Relying only on toxicology tests requires a level of training that most of the state's medical examiners lack Lewis said. Drugs metabolize at different rates. A person who has developed a tolerance for one prescription drug may test at what would be lethal rates for other individuals.
Small counties rising autopsy costs
Deaths are expensive for local communities. Counties that routinely order autopsies for drug overdoses have seen sharp increases in costs. In Bradley County for example where there were 18 drug related deaths this year by the end of July the autopsy budget of 68000 was exhausted by mid-year. Laura Wittmaier director of the medical examiner's office requested an additional 30000.
 Read moreOpioid crisis 'knows no bounds' says Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price
A handful of counties in northeast Tennessee who rely on the East Tennessee State University forensic center for autopsies have switched to a different fee model for autopsies. Instead of paying a per-body fee the counties pay an annual flat rate based on their population. In Washington County that has meant the medical examiner does not hesitate in ordering an autopsy on a suspected overdose.
The number of autopsies has ballooned said Washington County Mayor Dan Eldridge.
Inconsistent death records
The nation's death data is compiled by the Centers for Disease Control which relies on cause of death to track public health trends such as the number of people dying from diabetes heart disease or overdoses.
In overdose cases the CDC can track specific trends - such as a rise in opioid or heroin use. But only if medical examiners include the information on the death certificate.
USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee found medical examiners across the state take a vastly different approach to filling out death certificates.
Bradley County Medical Examiner Jeffrey Miller has typically written polypharmacy overdose for deaths in which multiple drugs are involved said Wittmaier who noted that lately he's gotten better at listing specific drugs.
Portis lists all identified drugs on the death certificate. Joe Fite medical examiner for Giles County does not. Instead writes prescription drug toxicity and notes all specific drugs on a separate form sent to the department of health that does not get included in death data.
Medical examiners also vary in noting the manner of death for suspected drug overdoses.
 After the ODKnox County looks at hiring post-naloxone case manager
In Bradley County the medical examiner typically categorizes overdose deaths as accidents unless there is clear evidence of suicide. In Benton County they are suicides if lethal drug doses are present. In Hamblen County Thompson takes the unusual step of classifying the majority of overdose deaths as natural because he said death is a natural progression of the disease of addiction.
Lewis strongly disagrees with that. Any death from external causes is not natural she said.
Medical examiners also face the challenge of synthetic drugs that are so new there is no test for them.
Last year for the first time in my career I put down as cause of death an 'unknown toxic substance secondary to addiction' said Thompson the medical examiner in Hamblen County. We knew he overdosed. Despite our best efforts we couldn't come up with what he overdosed on. We don't know what it is. We are getting synthetic drugs from China.
A study released this year by the University of Virginia found a specific drug was not listed in 19.5 percent of all overdose deaths. The lack of specificity on death certificates could mean overdose deaths are undercounted by as much as 24 percent nationwide the report concluded.
Hospitals don't report
In August 2015 the Knox County Regional Forensic Center issued an 81-page analysis of deaths in the region over a five-year period.
The report noted that it could not account for all deaths highlighting the lack of reporting by hospitals as one factor. When individuals die in hospitals and then required cremation local medical examiners are required to certify cause of death.
In some cases those requests prompted suspicion on the part of medical examiners who then sent bodies for autopsy. The Knox County facility found some were actually drug-related deaths.
The report urged state officials to implement a training program for hospitals and physicians to assure their understanding of reporting requirements and to create a system to hold these groups accountable for accurately reporting deaths.
A study by the CDC of Minnesota deaths released in April found that a significant number of opioid related deaths were wrongly recorded as pneumonia or other infectious diseases.
New approaches to collecting data
Lewis and her colleagues are working to address the problem by providing training to medical examiners and by painstakingly reviewing not only death certificates but supporting records with the goal of providing a more accurate count next year.
They have resorted to paying counties 25 per death to provide detailed forensic reports that help give state health officials a clearer picture of overdose deaths by 2018.
 Editorial National opioid epidemic emergency declaration will save lives
About 45 counties have begun complying according to Lewis. State law has long required medical examiners to submit those reports but many don't Lewis said.
Lewis said addressing the problem also requires money.
Small counties can't absorb the cost of numerous autopsies but the state could appropriate funding to ease that burden.
Knowing how a life was lost is important not only for public policy but for loved ones trying to make sense of a tragedy.
Families need closure said Lewis who has worked with death as a forensic pathologist for 16 years.

A longtime Tennessee doctor who moved to Indiana after five patients died of overdoses in less than a year will spend years in prison on federal drug charges.
Dr. Darrel Rinehart 66 who ran a clinic in Columbia for decades was indicted on 19 counts of distribution of a controlled substance in March 2019.
He was sentenced this week to three years in prison for unlawfully distributing controlled substances according to a news release from the Department of Justice.
At least five of Rineharts patients suffered fatal overdoses that were partially or wholly caused by drugs he prescribed between March 2015 and January 2016 according to public records.

AutopsyTennessee mother died of overdose in home baby son died of starvation dehydration
At least six more of his patients had nonfatal overdoses between 2014 and 2016 and one of those patients overdosed three times state health records showed.
He admitted distributing opioids to four different patients without legitimate medical needs on 18 different occasions between December 2014 and December 2015 the news release indicated.
He also admitted prescribing hydrocodone to a patient without underlying issues in January 2016.
The indictment indicated he routinely prescribed opioids and other drugs without legitimate medical purpose.
A joint investigation by The Tennessean and The Indianapolis Star in 2019 brought the case to the attention of the U.S. Attorney's Office which stepped in to investigate over local prosecutors. Local investigators had used an undercover informant to gain video footage inside Rinehart's clinic.
Before the doctor moved to Indiana the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners agreed to suspend Rineharts medical license if he agreed not to attempt to practice medicine in Tennessee.
The news release from the U.S. Attorney's Office refers to Rinehart as a former doctor.
Department of Justice units including the Medicare Fraud Strike Force and the Appalachian Regional Prescription Opioid Strike Force were involved in the investigation as was the federal Department of Health and Human Services the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and the local district attorney's office.

NASHVILLE Tenn.--A Nashville woman is facing multiple charges in the city and in Kentucky following the overdose death of a Lebanon woman in Kentucky.
The Metro Nashville Police Department MNPD reports 21-year-old Hannah Forkum was arrested on Wednesday during an undercover drug buy at the Motel 6 on Stewarts Ferry Pike.
Forkum was caught with 25 grams of fentanyl 27 grams of meth laced with fentanyl and 7 grams of black tar heroin.
Forkum is also accused of selling a deadly cocktail of drugs to a Lebanon woman at the hotel. According to police 21-year-old Baylee McClanahan purchased the narcotics from Forkum at the motel before overdosing on them while visiting a friend in Kentucky on Tuesday.
Police also arrested three men in Forkum's hotel room each wanted for outstanding warrants on separate charges. Forkum is facing charges in Kentucky for 2nd degree murder in addition to possessing fentanyl heroin and meth for resale. A handgun was also found in her hotel room at the time of her arrest.

Educating children making overdose-reversing drugs available to all state troopers and adding hundreds of prison beds to treat those fighting opioid addiction are part of Gov. Bill Haslam and legislative leaders' comprehensive 30 million proposal to combat the epidemic.
The proposal comes as Tennessee continues to fight the ongoing crisis which now claims at least three lives a day in Tennessee. More than 1600 residents died from drug overdoses in 2016.
It is no secret our country faces a huge challenge in the opioid epidemic Haslam said at a Monday press conference unveiling the initiative. Tennessee unfortunately is not an exception to the problem.
The plan  dubbed TN Together  will be funded with both federal and state dollars and consist of three main components prevention treatment and law enforcement.
The largest component is focused on treatment. The proposal calls for 25 million in state and federal funding to be directed toward paying for treatment and recovery programs for people who cannot afford them.
Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services Commissioner Marie Williams said anywhere from 6000 to 10000 members of the public could be provided assistance with the new money.
We are also meeting with private providers to see if we can get them to invest into a public-provide leverage to expand that number Williams said adding the state has also served an additional 5000 people using federal dollars.
The latest estimates indicate as many as 300000 Tennesseans are misusing drugs with 82000 addicted to drugs she said.

The opioid plan also includes adding recovery specialists to emergency rooms and supplying naltrexone a medication that eases cravings for the drug to the state's drug recovery courts and county jails.
The biggest thing we hear is that funding is desperately needed for treatment programs said House Speaker Beth Harwell who last year convened a task force that examined the crisis. Only a fraction of those people get the treatment they need.
Treatment she said costs far less than any other option including incarceration.

The plan also calls for targeted outreach for women of childbearing age who are chronic opioid users in order to prevent births of children exposed to drugs in utero. The plan includes revisions to the state's health education standards in order to increase prevention education.
The plan also calls for comprehensive changes for law enforcement including adding new Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agents and equipping all state troopers with naloxone  the drug that reverses or blocks the effects of opioids after an overdose.
Karen Pershing executive director of the Knoxville-based Metro Drug Coalition praised the plans focus on prevention treatment and enforcement but noted it has a lack of true resource investment in primary prevention the focus of MDC and other grassroots coalitions around the state.
While I agree that equipping the Tennessee Highway Patrol officers with naloxone is possibly preventing overdose deaths the addiction has already taken place Pershing said. It was disappointing to not have any acknowledgement of the role anti-drug coalitions such as the Metro Drug Coalition play in local communities. There is currently no state funding designated for substance abuse prevention coalitions in Tennessee.
Pershing applauded the effort to bring treatment into jails and prisons calling it a relatively inexpensive way to get treatment to a lot of people quickly. But she said the need for more access to evidence-based addiction treatment services in Tennessee is tremendous.
On the prevention side the proposal includes a plan to limit an initial opioid prescription to a five-day supply with appropriate exceptions. Those exceptions would apply to TennCare enrollees as well.
The plan also calls for re-purposing 512 beds in the state's West Tennessee prison to expand drug treatment services. It also calls for the creation of a drug treatment program that would allow inmates who completed it to receive a reduced sentence and add new recovery courts for people convicted of nonviolent crimes who are addicted to drugs.
Judge Duane Sloan who operates a drug recovery court in northeast Tennessee said the extra treatment options will help all courts. He hopes funding can be made available to create residential recovery units for women going through his courtroom. There are far fewer slots for women than men across the state.
Shelby County Mayor Mark H. Luttrell Jr. noted the impact of the epidemic which once was centered in east Tennessee but has since become prevalent throughout the state.
Luttrell announced plans two weeks ago for a public awareness campaign led by the Health Department use of third-party health vendors to monitor prescriptions and continued review of potential litigation against the pharmaceutical industry.
The opioid issue affects countless people here in Shelby County which is why the Shelby County Health Department and our many partnering healthcare agencies have launched an aggressive campaign about the dangers of opioids he said.
The comprehensive proposal comes after months of discussion among state officials including lawmakers on how to combat the ongoing crisis.
Last year a bipartisan legislative task force convened by Harwell R-Nashville made a host of recommendations including
Adding 25 agents to the TBI
Establishing a commission to combat drug abuse and
Creating a consistent approach to determining drug overdose deaths
Not all of the legislative task force's recommendations appear to have made it into the latest proposal. Haslam and other officials declined to say how many TBI agents would be hired.
Tennessee Department of Health Commissioner John Dreyzehner said his agency will continue to work with medical examiners to improvement reporting on drug overdoses.
The opioid plan is among Haslam's top legislative priorities for the session and will likely be prominently featured in the governor's final State of the State speech which is set for Jan. 29.
Ahead of the news conference Tennessee Democratic Party chair Mary Mancini said any effort to address the opioid crisis needs to begin with expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
Sen. Jeff Yarbro D-Nashville and Rep. Mike Stewart D-Nashville who were among the dozens of lawmakers present for the announcement called the 25 million proposed to address treatment needs compared to funds that could be accessed through a Medicaid expansion in the state - a plan that has no Republican support.
Haslam and several of his Republican colleagues scoffed at the criticism.
Rep. Bill Dunn R-Knoxville said I applaud the governor for coming forward to have a solution. If people want to stand on the side and shoot at him they can but I don't have a whole lot of respect for that.
Calling past efforts to combat the opioid crisis successful Haslam said the latest proposal is simply a comprehensive plan that takes into account what has already been done in recent years.

Frankita Davis pictured with her mother Betty died in March after taking a fentanyl-laced pill. She is one of the 712 suspected drug overdoses from 2021.
Listen
There were 712 suspected overdose deaths in Davidson County last year. And Betty Davis daughter was one of them.
I went in her bedroom on the 16th of March to find her transitioned she says.
Nashville set another record in 2021 for overdose deaths. Year-end figures released Thursday show a 15 increase from 2020 which was also a record high.
And loved ones of the victims say the crisis has morphed into a poisoning problem.
Davis 26-year-old Frankita lived with several ailments that meant she relied on pain medication. And when shed run out shed turn to a friend.
This time the pills she got werent what they looked like. They had enough fentanyl to kill her. The potent drug now plays a role in three-quarters of all Nashville overdose deaths.
Those are deliberate murders Davis says. Theres nothing accidental about making a pill lacing it with fentanyl and selling it to someone. Its no accident by no means.
Davis who has since connected with other surviving family members says so many overdoses are nothing more than poisonings for which someone should be prosecuted. As recently as December Metro Police charged someone with 2nd degree murder for distributing fentanyl that led to an overdose death. However at least in her case Davis says police have not pursued charges.
There are an increasing number of stories that are less tales of active addiction and more of one-time incidents.
Isiah James who went by Tre died August 20 2019. His mother was in the house at the time. She found him with his nose and mouth full of foam.
Angela Covington-James says she didnt have naloxone to reverse the overdose though she carries it now. He had been battling some depression and took a pill that apparently contained fentanyl.
We were taught not to take candy from strangers she says. Its now dont take medicine from anyone.
One of the largest obstacles for patients seeking effective substance abuse treatment is a lack of transportation to treatment facilities. Vanderbilt University researcher Janey Camp associate professor of civil and environmental engineering is working on a project to help clear those roadblocks.
Camp is leading an 18-month in-depth analysis of transportation investment opportunities that could help stem the opioid epidemic across Tennessee. The project is funded by the Tennessee Department of Transportation.
Tennessee has the third-highest opioid prescription rate in the nation and overdose deaths involving opioids in the state have been rising for more than a decade. Densely populated cities may offer the most transportation options to residents but even so public transit options are still no guarantee to accessible treatment. Camp explains that when applying this logic to rural areaswhich comprise nearly 93 percent of Tennesseeit is easy to understand the challenge of limited transportation options.
One of the most interesting pieces of the study for me will be when we review statewide data of substance abuse cases and different transportation options in those areas to see how travel time and cost modes of transport and location of treatment facilities intersect Camp said. She is collaborating on the research with Seth Guikema professor of industrial and operations engineering at the University of Michigan to assess currently available transportation and treatment options.
They will use the data to model a variety of scenarios that show how people can get to treatment facilities with improved transit options. From these models and other assessments the researchers will prioritize the transit optionspublic transit on-demand services such as ridesharing and infrastructurethat contribute most to mitigating the opioid epidemic.
Amid the COVID pandemic the researchers are also weighing how remote options like telehealth services are circumventing some issues related to transportation. People in recovery cannot rely solely on remote options Camp explained since many are required to submit biological samples on a regular basis. In addition data suggests that low income or rural patients may not have access to the technology or health care required to take advantage of telemedicine options.
We hope this project will help to make it easier for those in need of treatment to obtain the care they need and complete their treatment programs through innovative approaches to helping people gain access to treatment Guikema said.
Camp sees this project as a basis for new transportation design and implementation in Tennessee and other regions or states.
Growing up in rural Tennessee I have seen firsthand the challenges that result from lack of access to transportation and am looking forward to finding opportunities for change Camp said.

Marie Williams LCSW gratefully serves as Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services TDMHSAS. She was reappointed to her position by Governor Bill Lee on January 19 2019 and was initially appointed by Gov. Bill Haslam effective October 22 2016.
As Commissioner Ms. Williams oversees and leads the department in its role as the states public mental health and substance abuse authority. Under her leadership and with support from two different governors and the Tennessee General Assembly the TDMHSAS annual budget has grown from 337 million to about 730 million. In all the department serves approximately 750000 Tennesseans annually who are struggling with mental health and substance abuse issues. Ms. Williams provides leadership and oversight to more than 1850 full-time employees who assist individuals in securing prevention treatment and recovery services for serious mental illness serious emotional disturbances and substance abuse disorders. Her duties as commissioner also include system planning monitoring licensing evaluating and setting policy and quality standards collaborating with other state and community agencies and working to educate the community about mental health and substance abuse services. Ms. Williamss oversight responsibilities include about 1000 contracts with community mental health and substance abuse providers the operation of four regional mental health institutes with about 8000 annual admissions and contracts with three additional private psychiatric hospitals which serve about 3000 people annually.
In her time as Commissioner Ms. Williams has served as a leader in addressing several essential issues facing Tennessee including behavioral health workforce challenges mental health struggles of youth and young adults the opioid crisis criminal justice reform leveraging the abilities and resources of the faith-based community and expanding peer-led services but her career in behavioral health services has been marked by a special passion for housing.
Commissioner Williams began her career in Memphis Tennessee supporting people experiencing homelessness and mental illness. Her success there led to employment with TDMHSAS starting in 2000 as the Director of Housing Planning and Development. Her signature achievement the Creating Homes Initiative CHI has leveraged more than 1 billion and developed more than 32000 supportive housing options for people diagnosed with mental illness and co-occurring disorders. Based on the success of the original CHI program Governor Bill Lee and the Tennessee General Assembly expanded it twice to create housing for people recovering from substance use disorder CHI 2.0 and re-entering communities from incarceration CHI 3.0.
As the pandemic realities of workforce disruption burnout and uncertainty facing all sectors of the economy became clear Commissioner Williams convened and led a workgroup to study the issue gather data and establish solutions. The workgroup included representatives from treatment provider agencies consumer and family advocacy groups as well as universities and colleges that train the professionals working in the field. She also leveraged relationships at the states Medicaid agency to ensure that the entire sphere of public behavioral health was represented. Under Ms. Williamss leadership this diverse group of stakeholders developed a roadmap for Tennessees elected decisionmakers to consideration that eventually led to an additional 36 million recurring investment of state dollars for TDMHSAS contracted providers.
Another reality of the pandemic that Commissioner Williams realized early on was the outsized impact on the mental health of Tennessees youth and young adults. With support from Governor Bill Lee and the Tennessee General Assembly and in partnership with the departments contracted community mental health providers Ms. Williams created the Childrens Behavioral Health Safety Net. In the model of the existing Behavioral Health Safety Net for adults the Childrens BHSN ensured that any Tennessee child who was uninsured or underinsured would have access to essential outpatient mental health services. Commissioner Williams also led the expansion of the departments services for children and youth taking the School-Based Behavioral Health Liaison program from a few dozen counties to statewide and initiating the Tennessee Resiliency Project which allowed grant applicants unprecedented latitude in designing services to meet the need in their areas. Her leadership and decision making are essential as the department works to operationalize Governor Bill Lees 250 million K-12 Mental Health Trust Fund.
Under the direction of Gov. Bill Haslam Ms. Williams co-chaired a workgroup of commissioners state and local lawmakers and law enforcement officers to develop a comprehensive plan to address opioid addiction and reduce overdose deaths in Tennessee. This plan became known as TN Together and was the signature policy initiative of Gov. Haslams final year in office. The 30 million plan addressed the crisis by making significant investments in substance abuse treatment addiction prevention and law enforcement. Since then Ms. Williams has continued to advocate for expanded funding for prevention treatment and recovery services with more than 30 million in state funding added under the administration of Governor Bill Lee and more than 150 million in awarded federal grants since March 2020. As lawsuit settlements stemming from the opioid crisis send hundreds of millions of dollars to Tennessee Ms. Williamss leadership remains key as she serves as a non-voting member of the states Opioid Abatement Council.
Ms. Williamss efforts in criminal justice reform include advocating increasing funding and expanding the network of recovery courts to encompass 84 recovery courts in Tennessee with dozens more mental health courts starting operation soon. Additionally Ms. Williams is responsible for leadership and oversight of the departments juvenile justice program which created alternatives to out-of-home placements in areas of the state where options are limited. In 2019 Governor Bill Lee called on Commissioner Williamss leadership to chair the Behavioral Health Subcommittee of his Criminal Justice Investment Task Force. Additionally Ms. Williams has provided criminal justice leadership at the national level serving with the Council of State Governments Justice Center Advisory Board since 2018 and serving as the groups Chair starting in 2022.
Faith in God has always been a strong motivator for Ms. Williams as she moved through her personal and professional life and that influence showed her the value of direct outreach to communities of all faiths across Tennessee. During her time as Deputy Commissioner Ms. Williams helped create the Departments Faith-Based Initiative and under her leadership as Commissioner the initiative grew to encompass two department employees and four regional Faith-Based Community Coordinators. The programs signature achievement is Certified Recovery Congregation program which has certified more than 1000 houses of faith to create and share recovery resources and support Tennesseans in their journey of wellness.
Increasing the role of peer-led services has been a significant theme of Ms. Williamss time as Commissioner. Under her leadership programs in the department have been started andor greatly expanded that have placed Certified Peer Recovery Specialists in places where they can refer people to treatment work with communities of faith work inside of emergency departments train people on reversing overdose and more. Commissioner Williams responded to the demand for certified peers both from within the departments programs and from community providers and other settings by greatly increasing capacity in the departments CPRS trainings. As a result Tennessee reached a milestone with more than 1200 active CPRS during her tenure as Commissioner.
In her previous position as Deputy Commissioner Ms. Williams served as top advisor to the Commissioner and managed the departmental budget of more than 337 million. Ms. Williams successfully assisted in the departments transformation initiative which closed a 150-bed long-term care facility. Through strong partnership and collaboration with community providers all patients were transitioned into community-based care and the facilitys previous operating budget of 20.5 million was reinvested into community-based services. Ms. Williamss leadership secured the support of three East Tennessee private psychiatric in-patient hospital partners to provide services to those patients previously served by Lakeshore Mental Health Institute.
Commissioner Williams is the recipient of numerous professional and community awards from national and state groups including the Excellence in Advocacy Individual Achievement Award from the National Council for Behavioral Health the George Goodman and Ruth P. Brudney National Social Work Award from Mental Health America the Alumni Professional Achievement Award from the University of Tennessee Knoxville the Vision of Hope Award from NAMI Tennessee the Senator Douglas Henry Award for Service to Children and Families at Risk from the University of Tennessee College of Social Work. Ms. Williams lives in Nashville and she is the mother of Nikki Williams.

Tennessee hospitals have seen a quick resurgence in COVID cases since hitting a low point July 4.
Tennessee health officials say the state is beyond the opioid crisis and not in a good way. Theyre expanding their sights to include many more deadly drugs by calling it  broadly  an overdose crisis.
Fatal overdoses continue to climb in Tennessee and most still involve opioids. But its no longer conventional prescription painkillers directly to blame. Its illicit fentanyl often made in a clandestine lab. And increasingly victims also have either cocaine or meth in their system according to data from the Metro Health Department.
Nashville opioid response coordinator Trevor Henderson says the drug combinations reflect a larger concern.
We sort of have an addictive society he says. If that indeed is true and addiction is the underlying problem we cant focus on just one substance. We have to be broader than that.
More How Drug Combos Are Making Tennessees Opioid Problem Even More Deadly
If focused solely on opioids health officials might miss all the new instances of weekend drug users who end up overdosing because their cocaine was laced with powerful fentanyl says Henderson who reviews each overdose fatality in Davidson County.
Nationally researchers say there are as many as four separate drug epidemics occurring simultaneously with regional variations around the country.
Starting in January 2020 Tennessee is changing how it categorizes overdoses in the hospital. No longer will the reportable condition be opioid drug overdose but rather drug overdose as to include stimulants like meth and cocaine benzodiazepines and muscle relaxers.
The lawsuit claims Walgreens improperly dispensed 1.1 billion opioid pills between 2006 and 2020
Tennessee alleges the pharmacy giant didn't properly train pharmacists and missed 'red flags'
This is only the latest in a series of similar state opioid-related lawsuits
Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery announced on Wednesday the state is suing the retail pharmacy giant Walgreens over its unlawful sale and distribution of prescription opioids.
The lawsuit filed in Knox County Circuit Court focuses on Walgreens' operations between 2006 and 2020. According to Slatery the company's 200 to 300 pharmacies sold 1.1 billion oxycodone or hydrocodone pills roughly the equivalent of 175 pills for every state resident during this period.
Walgreens did not flood the state of Tennessee with opioids by accident Slatery said in a Wednesday evening news release. Rather the fuel that Walgreens added to the fire of the opioid epidemic was the result of knowing  or willfully ignorant  corporate decisions.
Opioid lawsuitsAttorney in Endo lawsuit says 35M settlement was opioid firm's best last offer
Opioid crisis'This is going to get a lot worse' Tennessee grapples with fentanyl crisis as thousands die
Slatery alleges among other things that Walgreens did not properly train pharmacists to recognize red flags for patient opioid abuse regularly sold huge quantities of high-risk drug combinations to patients did not properly take into account suspicious prescribers and prescribed suspiciously high doses of the drug to patients.
Walgreens' spokesman Fraser Engerman defended the company's actions.
Walgreens never manufactured or marketed opioids nor did we distribute them to the pain clinics and 'pill mills' that fueled this crisis Engerman wrote in an email. We will continue to defend against the unjustified attacks on the professionalism of our pharmacists dedicated healthcare professionals who live in the communities they serve.
Walgreens recently settled a similar claim filed by the state of Florida. According to the terms of that 683 million settlement the company paid 620 million to the state to be paid out over 18 years and a one-time payment of 63 million for attorneys' fees.
The deal did not include an admission of wrongdoing by Walgreens.
Tennessee won a 15.2 million share of a multi-state settlement with consulting firm McKinsey  Company last year over its promotion of opioid drugs. It similarly won a share of a 4.5 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma and a settlement with Endo Pharmaceuticals. Other lawsuits include those against AmericsoureBergen Drug Corp. and Food City Supermarkets LLC and K-VA-T Food Stores Inc.
Two people have been charged in connection with the drug overdose death of a 23-month-old child after a year-long investigation by Metro Nashville police.
Jesse Mashburn 36 and Melissa Sutton 46 were indicted by a grand jury after investigators said the toddler they were caring for Ariel Rose died of fentanyl ingestion on Nov. 11 2022 inside the Highroad Transitional Living Facility on 25th Avenue North.
The toddler had previously been living in the Brookmeade homeless encampment before her death according to other media reports.
Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid about 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times more potent than heroin.
Mashburn and Sutton were arrested Wednesday in a Hermitage apartment complex. Both are being held on 100000 bond.
Rose's grandfather Mickey Rose is suing Highroad Transitional Living Facility and Sutton as Ariel's babysitter saying both had obligations to keep the toddler away from drugs. He's seeking at least 15 million in damages court records show.
These places are supposed to help turn people's lives around Rose's attorney Isaac Kimes said in July. And very clearly as delineated in the lawsuit there were drugs running through this place like a river. And police were called out there I mean what we found in 2022 from January 1 until the day Ariel was found dead it was well over 100 times.
The lawsuit noted that Ariel was in the custody of her aunt but the woman had placed her in the care of her father Jonathan Rose who was living at the facility.
On the day of Ariel's death Jonathan Rose asked Sutton to watch the child the lawsuit said claiming that Sutton was a frequent user of illegal drugs. It claims the child came into contact with fentanyl in Sutton's room at some point.

NASHVILLE Tenn.The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services TDMHSAS is releasing new data showing the response to the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline in the state.
The three-digit number for the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline launched in mid-July 2022 after two years of planning preparation and expansion. In Tennessee that included distributing about 2.8 million in federal funding to community-based crisis call centers to hire dozens of new staff.
The preparation paid off with about 21000 Tennessee calls to 988 in the last six months of 2022. Thats an increase of about 500 calls per month over the previous 10-digit National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number. Tennesseans are also taking advantage of 988s ability to text or chat. In the last half of 2022 there were nearly 10000 texts to 988 and chats with 988lifeline.org from people in Tennessee.
Its never been easier to connect with mental health care in a crisis thanks to 988. Our state has an amazing network of crisis services and community mental health providers and 988 is unlocking the door to mental health help that so many people need right now said TDMHSAS Commissioner Marie Williams. We are grateful to our community partners who expanded to meet the demand and continue to respond to needs in a caring and compassionate way.
Even with the increased demand for assistance Tennessees crisis call centers are meeting or exceeding national benchmarks for in-state answer rate and time to answer. The federal agency that funds the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline sets targets at 90 in-state and 30 seconds. Any call thats not answered promptly in-state rolls over to a national backup call center so that no call goes unanswered.
The power of 988 and Tennessees crisis services continuum means that not only are you talking to someone in Tennessee the call-taker is probably in your region and knows the resources and probably has personal contacts who can help said TDMHSAS Director of Crisis Services and Suicide Prevention Jennifer Armstrong.
After the strong start in 2022 TDMHSAS is adding additional capacity in Nashville Knoxville and West Tennessee utilizing 1 million in supplemental funding from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and existing Mental Health Block Grant Funding. The department previously expanded chat and text capabilities in September 2022 to meet the demand during peak times.
Weve long said that we were going to follow the data in our approach to 988 and weve done just that. Were constantly learning more about how Tennesseans want to access help in a mental health crisis and increasingly that doesnt involve speaking to someone on the phone. said Matt Yancey LCSW TDMHSAS Deputy Commissioner for Community Behavioral Health Programs. Were grateful for the flexibility of our crisis call centers and their amazing staff as we work together to meet the need and connect people to care.

The list of priorities for lawmakers as they convened in Nashville last week for the start of the legislative session was lengthy.
Of those one of the topics likely to get the most attention this session is how lawmakers address the states growing opioid crisis.
According to state Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Service estimates 284412 Tennessee adults used heroin andor opioid pain relievers non-medically in 2016. Another 33325 Tennesseans ages 12-17 did the same.
Rep. Eddie Smith R-Knoxville has made it his goal this session to pass legislation geared toward helping the latter population by implementing recovery high schools schools that serve teens struggling with using drugs and alcohol across the state.
This is affecting everybody it doesnt matter your socioeconomic class Smith said about the crisis. Its affecting everybody across the board. This year we saw the son of the Nashville mayor pass away because of this. It doesnt matter if youre rich poor black or white everybody is affected by this. This is an issue.
Overall at least 1631 Tennesseans died from drug overdoses in 2016 up 12 percent from the 2015 but experts think the reported number is low due to inconsistencies in how counties investigate and report deaths.
How the schools would work
The high schools would be set up as non-residential treatment facilities that combine counseling and drug treatment with a high school curriculum. The high schools would serve as an option for parents wanting their child to get help and give juvenile court judges another tool in their tool belt.
Students would be dropped off and picked up like a normal school but the days may be a little longer than a normal school.
Hellen Ross McNabb regional vice president Mona Blanton-Kitts said the organization and Knox County Schools spent a good portion of 2017 before Smiths proposed legislation researching recovery high schools with the thought of possibly starting one in Knox County.
It allows the child to receive both a quality education and good treatment without having to sacrifice one or the other 
Credits would be transferable and diplomas would be from the school they were originally set to graduate from Smith said.
We dont want the stigma of a recovery high school to follow them into their career path in the future he said.
Recovery high schools can be effective
Andy Finch is an assistant professor of counseling and researcher at Vanderbilt University. Finch served as the former school director at Community High School a recovery school in Nashville that closed in 2008 and is considered a national expert on recovery high schools.
He said he is impressed and excited that state lawmakers are beginning to study the schools.
I would say with some confidence that the program is likely to work for a family in many different ways  my feeling is the peer support that is present in a recovery high school is the most important factor. We cant say that imperially but its something that the recovery high schools provide that really no other setting is going to provide he said.
In a 2017 published study Finch found recovery high school students were twice as likely to report complete abstinence from alcohol marijuana and other drugs 59 percent to 30 percent at their six month follow-up than students who did not attend a recovery high school.
Likewise in preliminary analysis for a not yet published study Finch said high school graduation rates for recovery high school students is at least 20 points higher than those who do not attend a recovery high school for at least 30 days.
Blanton-Kitts was thrilled that the state was beginning to look at recovery high schools because they work she said.
What we know is long-term treatment is much better than short-term treatment and treatment in the community and environment especially in a school-based setting is much better than taking a child out of the environment if possible.
What works best is them not going back to the same environment where the same triggers are she continued. If there is a recovery high school to go to it would extend their sober living and would continue their treatment they have been in.
Finch said there are around 40 recovery high schools across the country and only one in Tennessee Ridgecrest Academy in Nashville.
Ridgecrest had two students with the USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee wrote about it in the fall of 2016 and Finch said he didnt think the school had any students currently. Administrators at Ridgecrest could not be reached for comment.
The reason Community High School failed and Ridgecrest has struggled is due to the cost to families Finch said. Any cost to families is a barrier he said. Ridgecrests tuition was 25000 in 2016 and Community High Schools was around 12000 when it closed.
A lot of families have already spent money on treatment for kids  theyve already spent thousands on treatment and counseling services and medication Finch said.
Smith's proposal is for public recovery schools not private.
Making a dent
Under Smiths proposed legislation the state would set up three recovery high schools one in each grand division and would pull county state federal and grant funding to open the schools.
He expects the plan to cost about 100000 a year per school a figure that could rise but he points to Department of Mental Health figures that show the state spent 50.9 million in state and federal funds in fiscal year 2018 on adult substance abuse treatment but just 3.2 million on adolescent treatment plus another 170000 for Juvenile Recovery Court.
The proposed legislation does not stipulate how many employees would be needed but Smith said he imagines current school system employees would make the move to the school. The proposed legislation assumes existing facilities would be used.
Weve got to do more to reach our kids Smith said. Were throwing money at the back end of the problem. We need to be throwing it at the front end.
Of all the things we could fund with knowing we have a surplus going into the next year and going into the future this is one area where putting money is well worth the investment for what it will do Smith continued.
Knoxvilles Metropolitan Drug Commission Executive Director Karen Pershing agreed.
Either we intercept the problem in the early years when the behaviors start or were going to pay a whole lot more when theyre adults and the consequences will be a whole lot greater for all of us she said.

NASHVILLE NC WTVD -- The Nash County Sheriff's Office seized 173000 worth of heroin Sunday one of the largest heroin busts in the county's history.
Investigators say heroin is an epidemic.
It's affecting every community in our area Sheriff Keith Stone said. His officers took down the supplier through its Tar River Regional Taskforce a group of law enforcement agencies throughout eastern North Carolina.
Authorities arrested Billy Ray Johnson of Nashville during a traffic stop off I-95 in Halifax County after receiving a tip that he was trafficking heroin.
Stone said the powdery substance is destroying families every day in his community.
He said four people overdosed just last week.
Billy Ray Johnson is being held on a 500000 bond. Nash County Sheriff's Office
The mother and the daughter were doing heroin. The daughter overdoses. Her son actually overdosed and died in January. I see people leaving their families over this Stone said.
According to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services there have been more than 250 heroin deaths statewide.
Investigators said the drug is popular because it's cheap - costing roughly around 8.
RELATED Heroin causing havoc in Nash County
Stone said the drug is smuggled across the border and then trafficked into the community by local suppliers.
Johnson is facing felony drug-trafficking charges. He's being held on a 500000 bond.
Investigators hope this is a wake-up call to the community.
If you sell heroin you are committing murder and we will do everything we can to catch you Stone said.
In Nash County the Hope Initiative formed in February. The program allows people to go to Nashville police to turn in drugs or ask for help to get clean -- without any penalty.
So far six people have asked for help. Read more about the program here.

An investigation by the Tennessee Comptrollers Office shows that a Nashville-based nonprofit used grant money to make 42249.74 of unallowable payments including checks written to the executive director.
Successful Survivors is a nonprofit that assists individuals with mental illness and substance abuse issues. In 2018 the organization partnered with the Tennessee Department of Mental Health  Substance Abuse Services MHSAS to obtain 299670 in grant funds to purchase and renovate a home in Nashville to use as a rehabilitation house.
Investigators determined the executive director used these grant funds to pay himself developer fees totaling 27000. The executive director told investigators that he believed he deserved the payment for facilitating the property purchase and overseeing the renovation. Successful Survivors did not receive approval from MHSAS to pay these developer fees and failed to provide any written documentation justifying the payments.
Additionally investigators found that 4000 in grant funds was donated to the Greater Heights Missionary Baptist Church where the executive director of Successful Survivors serves as pastor. Contributions and donations are prohibited according to the Code of Federal Regulation grant guidelines.
Successful Survivors also failed to provide invoices or receipts for 34 payments totaling 9404.11 related to the renovation of the Nashville home and paid miscellaneous unallowable taxes totaling 1845.63 with grant funds.
Other findings noted by investigators include Successful Survivors filing false information with the Internal Revenue Service and Tennessee Secretary of State.
The results of this investigation have been communicated to the Office of the District Attorney General of the 20th Judicial District.
Nonprofits must ensure they collect and retain adequate documentation to support grant expenditures said Comptroller Mumpower. Its also vital the Board of Directors provide adequate oversight to implement internal controls over financial reporting and other operations.

Two and a half billion pain pills. That's how many opioids were supplied to Tennessee over six years according to data recently released by The Washington Post.
The data from the Drug Enforcement Administration shows the top distributors manufacturers and pharmacies for pain pills across the nation  a glimpse into the legal but opaque world of opioid prescriptions.
One out of every three opioid overdose deaths nationwide involved prescription pain pills in 2017 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
As the nation's opioid epidemic surged so did the pills climbing nearly 51 percent in the six-year period covered by the database from 2006 to 2012. The data revealed that towns struggling with addiction were the ones with the most pills pumped into them.
The Post and HD Media which publishes the Charleston Gazette-Mail in West Virginia sued for access to the database. Government regulators and the drug industry fought to prevent its release. The now publicly-available data is limited to hydrocodone and oxycodone.
In Tennessee Walgreens was the top distributor of pain pills pushing out half a billion in six years. The leading pharmacy was Reeves-Sain Extended Care in Murfreesboro co-owned by state Sen. Shane Reeves.
Reeves-Sain Extended Care provided prescriptions to long-term care and hospice facilities. Typically long-term care pharmacies pre-package medication for nursing homes assisted living and similar health care providers.
We provided a great deal of medication based on the needs of chronic conditions and end-of-life care said Amanda Cecconi a spokeswoman for TwelveStone Health Partners which is the current name for Reeves' business. Reeves-Sain was one of the largest providers to those organizations in this state and across 10 others.
In spite of the opioid issue in our state we cant punish patients who are dying from cancer COPD heart failure and other conditions who are in significant pain.
Reeves who has served as a senator since 2018 worked as a pharmacist in Murfreesboro for 25 years. The retail portion of Reeves-Sain pharmacy sold in 2015 to Fred's Inc. It has since closed.
The extended care component was spun off and is now operated under the name TwelveStone Health Partners. Reeves is the company's CEO.

A former Columbia doctor pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful distribution of controlled substances in Federal Court on Monday in a victory for the nation's ongoing battle against the misuse of opioids.
Dr. Darrel Rinehart who was previously affiliated with Maury Regional Medical Group until 2016 and later moved to Indiana where he continued to practice admitted Monday that in January 2016 he knowingly distributed hydrocodone a Schedule II controlled substance to a patient who did not have any significant underlying health issues justifying such a prescription.
A statement from the Department of Justice and United States Attorney Donald Q. Cochran of the Middle District of Tennessee also indicated Rinehart further admitted to distributing Schedule II controlled substances primarily opioids to four different patients without a legitimate medical purpose and outside the course of professional practice on 18 other occasions between December 2014 and December 2015.
The former local doctor is planned to be sentenced on July 30 2020 by Chief U.S. District Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw Jr. He faces up to 20 years in prison and up to a 1 million fine according to the federal department.
The Office of Inspector General U.S. Department of Health and Human Services The Tennessee Bueaur of Investigation and the District Attorney General for the Tennessee's 22nd Judicial District investigated the case.
Assistant Chief Kilby Macfadden and Trial Attorney William M. Grady of the Criminal Division's Fraud Section are prosecuting the case.
In March Rinehart 64 was indicted on 19 counts of prescribing controlled substances without a legitimate medical purpose after at least four of his patients died from drug overdoses according to a news release from the Department of Justice.
He was one of 32 Tennessee doctors and
medical professionals charged with crimes related to over-prescribing opioids in the national crackdown on individuals who prescribed addictive medications without justification.
After Rinehart was caught on undercover video increasing a patient's opioid prescription without any examination by a member by the Maury County Sheriff's Department the Columbia doctor's medical license was suspended by the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners.
Maury Regional Medical Group previously said it employed Dr. Rinehart as well as other physicians of CORE Physicians an independent Columbia medical practice starting September 1 2015. Rinehart's employment was terminated approximately 15 months later on Nov. 22 2016 a spokesperson from the medical center said.
A local drug task force sent in an informant and acquired various painkillers from Rinehart who did not conduct any sort of examination of the undercover agent District Attorney Brent Cooper previously told The Daily Herald.
Because federal charges carry more time Cooper and his office chose to not prosecute Rinehart including a reckless homicide change the district attorney's office was investigating.
I am glad to see that he is being held accountable for his habits of over prescribing these dangerous drugs Cooper said Monday. He will never be able to dispense drugs again and cause harm to others.
Cooper said he would have preferred to see the federal charge include homicide.
I hope that this will give the families of these victims some peace and satisfaction as the death of their loved ones allowed us to collect the evidence that likely led to his prosecution Cooper said. Opioids are still a huge problem and causing death on a daily basis.
Although charges connected the former Columbia doctor to four fatal overdoses an investigation carried out by The Tennessean and The Indianapolis Star indicate at least five of Rinehart's patients died due to drugs he prescribed between March 2015 and January 2016. Another six patients suffered nonfatal overdoses between 2014 and 2016 according to the investigation.
Rinehart told the medical board he was ignorant of safe prescribing laws the Associated Press reported.
The charges against the former local doctor are part of a national crackdown which included 60 medical professionals from seven states in what is considered to be the single-largest prescription opioid law enforcement operation in U.S. history.
With a total of 32 medical professionals charged from the Volunteer State more than half of the 60 defendants in the national operation are from Tennessee. Nine people are facing charges from Middle Tennessee following the national operation.
Jeff Young a nurse practitioner from Jackson is accused of trading fentanyl patches for sex.
Dr. Timothy Abbott a South Nashville Podiatrist is charged with seven counts of prescribing a controlled substance without a legitimate medical purpose
Medical professionals in Kentucky Louisiana Ohio West Virginia Alabama and Pennsylvania were all charged in the massive takedown. Across all states the suspects included 31 doctors seven pharmacists eight nurse practitioners and seven other licensed medical professionals according to a Department of Justice news release.
The opioid epidemic is the deadliest drug crisis in American history and Appalachia has suffered the consequences more than perhaps any other region said U.S. Attorney General William Barr in a press release on the operation. But the Department of Justice is doing its part to help end this crisis.
With a total of 6052014 painkiller prescriptions across the state there were 1304 deaths caused by opiod overdoses in 2018 according to a report from the Tennessee Department of Health.
Last year 23 people died from drug overdoses in Maury County 18 which were opioid overdose deaths and 3 involved heroine.
In 2017 the county recorded 246 nonfatal overdose outpatient visits and 96 nonfatal overdose inpatient stays.
The department indicates nearly three fourths of drug overdose deaths in Tennessee in 2017 were associated with opioids. There were 1268 overdose deaths associated with all opioids and of those 644 were associated with prescription opioids for pain which include drugs such as hydrocodone oxycodone morphine and codeine. Those drugs were associated with more overdose deaths than any other group of drugs for the year.
In 2014 a total of 1263 died from drug-related overdoses in the state. In 2015 that number increased to 1451 and again in 2016 to 1631 with an estimated 432000 people in need of recovery resources. Drug overdoses are also the number one cause of death of people under age 55.
Tennessee families will soon receive state-funded assistance to battle addiction and keep children out of foster care.
On Monday the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse announced a 5-year 3 million program designed to help families and children affected by opioids and other substance abuse by addressing addiction improving permanency and enhancing the safety of children in affected households.
When addiction hits a person it impacts their whole family in ways that will be felt for years to come said Commissioner Marie Williams in a press release. Weve seen time and time again that if a person can achieve recovery they can unlock the door to being the parent they always wanted to be.
Tennessee is among the hardest-hit states by the opioid epidemic a crisis now known to have been aided by pharmaceutical companies misrepresenting the addictive nature of opioids during the 1990s and encouraging prescriptions. The over-prescription played a major role in widespread misuse and rural areas were particularly hard-hit.
In 2017 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared the U.S. Opioid Epidemic a public health emergency.
In Tennessee there were 2388 opioid overdose deaths in 2020 more than 4 million painkiller prescriptions in 2021 and 824 babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome in 2020 according to the Tennessee Department Health.
Because the opioid crisis has primarily affected rural counties Tennessee and its partners will be focusing on nine counties in Middle Tennessee Bedford Coffee Franklin Giles Hickman Lawrence Lincoln Marshall and Maury counties.
Families will be provided intensive in-home crisis intervention and life skills education to help them fight addiction and create better home lives for children.
Because the services are coming to them travel expenses and other barriers preventing families from receiving care should no longer be an issue said Matthew Parriot spokesman for the Department of Mental Health.
The desired outcome is to avoid out of home placement at the end of the day everyone wants the same thing to keep the family together because thats whats best for the kids he said.
The department is also partnering with the Tennessee Department of Childrens Services Department of Human Services the Administrative Office of the Courts and Centerstone a nonprofit organization providing crisis-intervention services.
Grant funding for the program runs through September 2027.
Tennessees mental health department runs a similar program called Therapeutic Intervention Education and Skills TIES to assist children up to 18 years old at risk of being placed in foster care due to their caregivers substance abuse.
Dr. Darrel Rinehart had at least 5 patients die from overdoses in less than a year.
Rinehart has been indicted federally for overprescribing opioids.
State prosecutors were also preparing to charge him with reckless homicide.
Tennessee law enforcement were pursuing reckless homicide charges against an overprescribing doctor who had 5 patients die of overdoses in one year but recently passed the investigation to federal prosecutors as part of a massive opioid crackdown.
Dr. Darrel Rinehart 63 who practiced for decades in Columbia but moved to Indiana after his prescriptions were questioned was arrested two weeks ago on federal drug charges. He was one of 31 doctors indicted across six states in a sweeping effort to combat the opioid crisis in criminal court.
However if Rinehart had not been indicted in federal court he would likely have still been arrested.
Maury County District Attorney Brent Cooper confirmed this week that his office was nearly ready to present a grand jury with five charges of reckless homicide against Rinehart but Cooper gave their case to federal prosecutors because federal drug crimes would be easier to prove and carried harsher punishments. A reckless homicide prosecution in state court would not be an easy case to win Cooper said.
People in this area hold doctors in very high esteem Cooper said. I think convincing 12 citizens beyond a reasonable doubt that what Dr. Rinehart did amounts to reckless homicide would have some difficulties. But I dont think it would be impossible and we were certainly going to try if the federal authorities had not reached out to us first.
Rinehart who practiced in Columbia for two decades was the subject of a joint investigation by The Tennessean and The Indianapolis Star that published earlier this year. The investigation revealed at least five of Rineharts patients suffered fatal overdoses that were partially or wholly caused by drugs he prescribed between March 2015 and January 2016 and health officials were also suspicious of two more deaths of patients who were taking Rineharts prescriptions. Six more Rinehart patients had nonfatal overdoses between 2014 and 2016 including one patient who overdosed three times.
In several cases Rinehart gave his patients whopping prescriptions  despite red flags of abuse  only a few days before they died.
Cooper said that federal prosecutors contacted him after The TennesseanIndianapolis Star story published interested in taking command of his ongoing Rinehart investigation. The investigation was all but completed Cooper said but it was clear the case would be stronger in federal court.
After discussing it with them we realized the federal charges they could potentially charge Dr. Rinehart with carried a much longer sentence than reckless homicide on the state level Cooper said. We also had issues with one or two of our cases where we were close to running out the statue of limitation on some of the earliest overdose deaths.
Ultimately federal prosecutors indicted Rinehart on 19 counts of prescribing controlled substances without a legitimate medical purpose. Court records say those prescriptions went to four patients all of whom died while under Rineharts care.
Rinehart is not facing federal homicide charges. Cooper said his office is no longer planning to prosecute Rinehart in state court.
Rinehart pleaded not guilty to all charges during his first court appearance on April 22. He declined to comment when questioned by a reporter.

Frankita Davis pictured with her mother Betty died in March after taking a fentanyl-laced pill. She is one of the 712 suspected drug overdoses from 2021.
Listen
There were 712 suspected overdose deaths in Davidson County last year. And Betty Davis daughter was one of them.
I went in her bedroom on the 16th of March to find her transitioned she says.
Nashville set another record in 2021 for overdose deaths. Year-end figures released Thursday show a 15 increase from 2020 which was also a record high.
And loved ones of the victims say the crisis has morphed into a poisoning problem.
Davis 26-year-old Frankita lived with several ailments that meant she relied on pain medication. And when shed run out shed turn to a friend.
This time the pills she got werent what they looked like. They had enough fentanyl to kill her. The potent drug now plays a role in three-quarters of all Nashville overdose deaths.
Those are deliberate murders Davis says. Theres nothing accidental about making a pill lacing it with fentanyl and selling it to someone. Its no accident by no means.
Davis who has since connected with other surviving family members says so many overdoses are nothing more than poisonings for which someone should be prosecuted. As recently as December Metro Police charged someone with 2nd degree murder for distributing fentanyl that led to an overdose death. However at least in her case Davis says police have not pursued charges.
There are an increasing number of stories that are less tales of active addiction and more of one-time incidents.
Isiah James who went by Tre died August 20 2019. His mother was in the house at the time. She found him with his nose and mouth full of foam.
Angela Covington-James says she didnt have naloxone to reverse the overdose though she carries it now. He had been battling some depression and took a pill that apparently contained fentanyl.
We were taught not to take candy from strangers she says. Its now dont take medicine from anyone.
NewsChannel 5 explores the ongoing opioid crisis in Tennessee and tell the stories of some of those impacted by the issue.
State continues focus on prescriptions to combat opioid crisis
For many the reality of the opioid crisis has ripped families apart.
In total 1776 people died of a drug overdose in Tennessee in 2017. Deaths related to opioids counted for nearly 1300.
It is a number that continues to rise despite efforts to cut down on the number of opioid prescriptions. Pinpointing the exact cause of the problem can spark debate but many would not deny that overprescribing painkillers was one of the root issues.
Althea Myles is recovering from nearly a decade-long addiction to opiates at the recovery center Turning Point in Southaven Mississippi.
She said it all began when she was prescribed Percocet following a surgery.
I can recall going back to my doctor and telling him I have a problem and he proceeded to give me extra drugs Myles said. I have to accept I played a part at one point. I did know better but if somebody keeps giving you something and you go to him for advice you tell your mind it's ok.
Andrea Kirchner is also recovering through a program at Turning Point. She started abusing Percocet four years ago before she turned to heroin because it was cheaper and stronger.
I was a functioning addict very well. I ran a business and was a successful business but as my addiction got worse my business went under within two years Kirchner explained.
Opioid abuse does not discriminate on race sex and income. It is evident when you sit in at one of the counseling sessions helping patients learn how to communicate properly again.
Kirchner said she is finally recovering on her own terms and hopes to get her family back.
Will I get my family back I have to show them I'm serious this time and I am because I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. There's nobody to rush home to. There's nobody. I'm trying to do this for me finally I'm doing it for me she said.
To help battle the opioid crisis Governor Bill Haslam unveiled the 30 million plan TN Together. It focuses on law enforcement prevention and treatment. Limiting the number of prescriptions is one key component in the plan.
Under the new law healthcare practitioners may give an opioid prescription of up to three days with a 180 MME total dosage to patients in need of a small dosage.
Depending on the condition they can also prescribe opiates of up to 10 or 20 days but would require extra steps including conducting a thorough evaluation of the patient document consideration of alternative treatment plans for pain and why an opioid was used and obtained informed consent.
Dr. Chapman Sledge chief medical officer at Cumberland Heights said the problem became worse in the early 2000's when standards changed. The medical community then considered pain as a fifth vital sign.
You would have never dreamed of using opiates to treat chronic non-malignant pain in the early or mid 80's.The medical profession was sold a bill of goods that there's this epidemic of under treated pain and prescriptions skyrocketed after 2001. Things absolutely snowballed Dr. Sledge said.
Advocates pushed for the use of opioids like OxyContin while pharmaceutical companies claimed the drugs were less harmful and less addictive.
By 2015 the Centers for Disease Control CDC reported there were enough opioids to treat every American around the clock for three weeks. It said more than 11.5 million people reported misuse of prescription pain medicine in 2016.
Earlier this year Tennessee officials filed a lawsuit again Purdue Pharma the manufacturer of OxyContin for fueling the opioid crisis. It claimed the company valued profit over people despite knowledge of the drug's addictive risks over time.
The state's largest insurance provider Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee has since announced it will no longer cover OxyContin by January 1st. The insurance company will encourage doctors to use two more expensive alternatives Xtampza and Morphabond which are more difficult to abuse. Customers will pay the same copay and BlueCross will absorb the additional cost.
There are reports the number of prescriptions nationwide has gone down last year. Health data firm IQVIA's Institute for Human Data Science said actual dispensed opioid prescription decreased 10 percent while patients receiving high doses declined by 16 percent.
However Tennessee still has a high rate of prescribing.
Hospitals like St. Thomas Midtown have focused on limiting opiates by offering different drug combinations. Dr. Allison Bollinger said it is proving to be helpful.
There's been recent data that shows that if you take ibuprofen and combine it with Tylenol it's as effective as Lortab for pain Bollinger said. It's really important to engage our patients and to have conversations with them in the reasons why we're selecting a non-opioid alternative.
In addition the hospital is already able to access a database that would allow doctors to search how many painkillers a patient has been prescribed and by how many different providers in the country. It also keeps doctors accountable too.
To receive help like Myles and Kirchner you can call the Turning Point hotline number at 1-888-614-2251 or visit turningpointtreatment.org.
Fentanyl deaths make opioid crisis rampant
While data so far reveals a decline in opioid prescriptions amid a crackdown the number of deaths continues to spike not just statewide.
Deaths related to fentanyl passed heroin deaths for the first time in 2017 according to the Tennessee Department of Health. It was associated with 500 deaths a 70 percent increase since 2016.
Fentanyl is a drug similar to heroin but is more potent and can be 100 times stronger than morphine.
T.J. Jordan of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said despite countless warnings and advisories drug users are seeking fentanyl or something even stronger.
With the Chinese government tightening its belt on fentanyl distributed to the U.S. Jordan said it became prime opportunity for drug cartels to infiltrate communities.
However pill press machines are being used in home labs to cut fentanyl into a counterfeit pill or other substances like heroin. Drug users could unknowingly buy illicit drugs and not realize how potentially deadly it is.
What happens is you get one pill right out of the gate that has no fetnanyl in it next may have a sprinkle next may have some spattering and next mostly high content of fentanyl Jordan explained.
Jordan said he heard a story at a recent conference regarding heroin laced with arsenic.
It's a poison that will absolutely kill you and people know it will kill you but yet the drug user is looking
for that high so bad they're willing to go to the drastic measure of having heroin with arsenic in it to put in their bodies Jordan said.
However the problem seems to have no end in sight now that people are using drugs in group settings with a designated person.
Narcan the brand name for Naloxone is available to help revive a person who is overdosing. Depending on the strength of the drug or counterfeit substance laced with a typically unknown amount of fentanyl it may take multiple doses of Narcan to prevent deaths.
We're starting to see where drug addicts are using together with their colleagues in an attempt that if they crash there is somebody there to revive them Jordan added.
Narcan can be administered through a nasal spray or intravenously. Law enforcement and emergency departments like the Rutherford County EMS has been equipped with Narcan for years.
The county used Narcan 123 times in 2013 but it spike last year to 415.
As the need for Narcan grows so does the price. The Nashville Fire Department saw the cost nearly triple in the last seven years.
To help respond to scenes even faster Rutherford County EMS has been using what's called power units. They are crews already roaming around waiting to respond to any emergency.
They go out into the neighborhoods and theyre high visibility on the streets so when a call for service comes in they're the first ones that get the call paramedic Brandon Smith said.
Officials said it's making a difference. An average response time in Rutherford County is about eight minutes.
The deputy director of EMS said with the power units its able to go down to 7.5 or 7.2 minutes. It's a slight change but when it comes to emergencies every second matters.
But with recent opioid laws there are also concerns the use of fentanyl abuse or heroin will increase especially from the pain community potentially increasing the amount of deaths.
Chronic pain patients like Chantal Burke who rely and function on opioids say recent regulations may force others to seek drugs on the streets that are easier and cheaper to get.
The Tennessee Pain Society says doctors have opted out of treating patients or prescribing opioids in general because of stricter rules. There is also fear of legal consequences.
As a result existing pain clinics have been swarmed
Some of the practices I understand are actually no longer accepting any more patients because they're just saturated Dr. John Schneider of the Tennessee Pain Society said.
In 2015 there were more than 350 pain management providers in the state. The number has now dwindled to less than half.
Over the summer Comprehensive Pain Specialist abruptly closed its clinics in the state amid Medicare fraud allegations. It left thousands of chronic pain patients fearful and scrambling to find another provider who'd accept their insurance.
Many fear it would push patients to commit suicide if drugs they have relied on to treat their excruciating pain aren't easily accessible.
Tennessee children left behind by opioid crisis
Sitting on her grandmothers couch inside a tiny apartment on Nashvilles West Side Sandrell Newsome is twirling the ends of her braided black hair between two fingers she is 11-years-old and has been left behind by Tennessees growing opioid crisis.
Sandrell was seven-years-old when both her mother and father were arrested for selling opioids. With both of her parents in jail Sandrell along with her five brothers and sisters were forced to move in with their grandmother Sherl Cox. Sandrells youngest sister is four-years-old her oldest brother is 17 all of them are crammed into this two-bedroom brick apartment that is in desperate need of being renovated. It smells of cigarette smoke and dog food.
With her feet tucked beneath her Sandrell glances off in the distance as she talked about her mom and dad Its hard because theyre our parents and most people expect kids to live with their parents.
This sixth grader is one of the lucky ones in this nationwide epidemic that is leaving behind broken families and broken hearts. Sandrells mother Sharon wasnt using drugs when she was pregnant with any of her kids so none of them were born addicted. Theirs though is the reality hundreds of thousands of families across the country are facing right now. By some estimates more than 1 million children are living with their grandparents because their parents are addicted to opioids.
Sandrell is shy but her grandmother gently coaxes her to talk more about whats happened to their family Ive learned that drugs are not the answer to anyones problem.
A bit of a nervous smile appeared on Sandrells face as she continued talking about the life her and brothers and sister have been forced into It creates a mess for everyone.
The mess the opioid epidemic has created is multifaceted and complicated. Not just emotionally but financially as well. At least twice a month Sherl Cox known in this quickly gentrifying neighborhood as Mama Sherl is forced to go to a nearby food bank because she regularly runs out of food to feed all six kids she has taken custody of.
Im barely making it living here. I pay 800 a month and I work at Burger King so Im barely living Sherl says her voice cracking a bit.
On the day we met Sherl and Sandrell their kitchen was filled with only a few loaves of white bread some peanut butter and instant noodles. Sherl makes every dollar she spends on these six kids last as long as possible.
We just have to make it day by day. We do our best. We survive Sherl said.
This struggling family thought the opioid crisis had already taken enough from them. But in August it delivered another devastating blow after the childrens father Mandrell Newsome died of a heroin overdose.
He was 36-years-old.
Its killing them every day every day. Every day someone is dying of an overdose Sherl says raising her voice with passion.
Sandrell though is not quite as animated when she talks about her dad the young girls tone got quieter as she described how her father died He had taken some drugs and there was poison in them. He was in the hospital for a couple of weeks and they just had to let him go.
Like so many others addicted to opioids Sandrells father turned to heroin because he couldnt afford the prescription pain pills he was craving. Doctors believe the final dose of heroin that killed Mandrell Newsome was likely laced with the drug fentanyl. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse more than 115 people die each day from overdosing on heroin. Every three weeks as many people die of an overdose and they did on September 11th.
Its a reality Sandrell struggles to comprehend.
Its very sad and lonely she said.
It hurts just to know what they have to deal with living without a father in their life so its hard her grandmother adds.
None of Mandrell Newsomes children have been to visit her fathers grave. It sits on the edge of a tiny family cemetery in Kingston Springs Tennessee about 20 minutes west of Nashville.
His family still hasnt been able to afford to buy him a headstone. Only some wilting flowers and a white name placard indicate where Mandrell is buried. Another victim of a crisis that seemingly has no end and another family left behind to deal with the aftermath.
Sherl is able to help her grandchildren through the Family  Children's Services. The Davidson County Relative Caregiver Program provides emotional and practical supports for children and the non-parental relatives who care for them.
Recovery navigators help addicts find treatment
Fighting opioid abuse is getting a boost of support from people who have overcome the same dark addiction in the past.
As of this month a program under the TN Together plan will get to pair people who were revived from a drug overdose with so-called recovery navigators in Nashville.
Recovery navigators are people who have been in recovery for at least two years and completed the Certified Peer Recovery Specialist Program.
Their goal is to connect with patients at the hospital and get them much needed help and support.
Once they're able to give consent the doctor will ask them if they would like to speak to someone and want help. Then they will call one of us and we respond. We give them resources share a little bit of our story of how we've been there and what we've been through and just that there is hope and this is not the end Coon explained.
Coon recovered from her opioid addiction four years ago at Buffalo Valley. She admitted herself to the treatment center after she overdosed on heroin laced with fentanyl.
I remember praying for God to please let me wake up and I wouldn't do this again she said. I knew at that point I did not want to live like that anymore.
Since then she went from being a client to an employee. She jumped on the opportunity to become a recovery navigator because she knows the importance of making a connection.
Doctors counselors and psychiatrists tried to get me sober for a long time until I got my counselor and she had been through the same thing I've been through. That makes a difference so I know it makes a difference Coon said.
Currently there are 11 recovery navigators across the state. Four of them are in the Mid-State.
Under TN Together 25 million focuses on providing treatment to drug users. Part of it includes the expansion of peer recovery specialists in targeted high-need emergency departments.
The program first started in upper East Tennessee and made its way to Memphis and then Nashville. Chattanooga and Knoxville are next on the list.
St. Thomas and TriStar Skyline Medical Center are two hospitals who are a part of the program. The state hopes to include more hospitals in the future.
Tennessee's Opioid Abatement Council is releasing its first community grants totaling nearly 81 million to programs treating opioid addiction.
The council approved 116 grants to 85 entities across the state at a meeting on Monday. The money comes from settlements with opioid producers distributors pharmacies and marketers litigated by the Tennessee Attorney General.
When the history of the opioid crisis in our state is written people will look back at this date as a landmark on the road to healing the unbelievable harm done to so many families and communities Opioid Abatement Council Chairman Stephen Loyd said in a news release.
The recipients include several Middle Tennessee organizations governments and universities including 2.1 million to the Metro Nashville government for an Opioid Care System Project.
Other Middle Tennessee recipients include 2.9 million to Belmont University for a mobile clinic and training program 2.6 million to Meharry Medical College for various projects 441268 to Antioch ministry Men of Valor for recovery support for formerly incarcerated people 4.1 million to Middle Tennessee State University for various projects 495000 to Nashville CARES for its Drug Awareness Response Team 2.9 million to Vanderbilt University Medical Center for various projects as well as many others. The full list of recipients is here.
Among the selected programs 32.8 million will go to toward treatment 19 million will go toward recovery support 12.2 million will go toward primary prevention 8.2 million will go toward education and training 8.1 million will go toward harm reduction and 750000 will go toward research and evaluation values are approximate.
We are gratified to see that money put to good use by the Council and the grant recipients Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said in the news release. We have ensured that settlement money will flow into the trust fund for years to come and we thank the Opioid Abatement Council and its chairman Dr. Stephen Loyd for their wise stewardship of these hard-earned dollars.
The Tennessee General Assembly established the Opioid Abatement Council in 2021 to decide how to distribute money received from lawsuits related to the opioid crisis.
Settlement funds are first split with 15 going to county governments and 15 going to state government while the remaining 70 goes to the Opioid Abatement Trust Fund. Thirty-five percent of the fund goes to county governments while the remaining  what was released in this round of grants  goes to community groups.
The council released 31.4 million to county governments for opioid abatement in February 2023.

The lawsuit claims Walgreens improperly dispensed 1.1 billion opioid pills between 2006 and 2020
Tennessee alleges the pharmacy giant didn't properly train pharmacists and missed 'red flags'
This is only the latest in a series of similar state opioid-related lawsuits
Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery announced on Wednesday the state is suing the retail pharmacy giant Walgreens over its unlawful sale and distribution of prescription opioids.
The lawsuit filed in Knox County Circuit Court focuses on Walgreens' operations between 2006 and 2020. According to Slatery the company's 200 to 300 pharmacies sold 1.1 billion oxycodone or hydrocodone pills roughly the equivalent of 175 pills for every state resident during this period.
Walgreens did not flood the state of Tennessee with opioids by accident Slatery said in a Wednesday evening news release. Rather the fuel that Walgreens added to the fire of the opioid epidemic was the result of knowing  or willfully ignorant  corporate decisions.
Opioid lawsuitsAttorney in Endo lawsuit says 35M settlement was opioid firm's best last offer
Opioid crisis'This is going to get a lot worse' Tennessee grapples with fentanyl crisis as thousands die
Slatery alleges among other things that Walgreens did not properly train pharmacists to recognize red flags for patient opioid abuse regularly sold huge quantities of high-risk drug combinations to patients did not properly take into account suspicious prescribers and prescribed suspiciously high doses of the drug to patients.
Walgreens' spokesman Fraser Engerman defended the company's actions.
Walgreens never manufactured or marketed opioids nor did we distribute them to the pain clinics and 'pill mills' that fueled this crisis Engerman wrote in an email. We will continue to defend against the unjustified attacks on the professionalism of our pharmacists dedicated healthcare professionals who live in the communities they serve.
Walgreens recently settled a similar claim filed by the state of Florida. According to the terms of that 683 million settlement the company paid 620 million to the state to be paid out over 18 years and a one-time payment of 63 million for attorneys' fees.
The deal did not include an admission of wrongdoing by Walgreens.
Tennessee won a 15.2 million share of a multi-state settlement with consulting firm McKinsey  Company last year over its promotion of opioid drugs. It similarly won a share of a 4.5 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma and a settlement with Endo Pharmaceuticals. Other lawsuits include those against AmericsoureBergen Drug Corp. and Food City Supermarkets LLC and K-VA-T Food Stores Inc.

ASHLAND CITY Tenn. WTVF  More than half of drug overdoses in Nashville are linked back to fentanyl.
It's not just a Metro problem it's all across the state. One mother knows this unfortunately too well.
Tonya Garton buried her son a year ago after a fentanyl overdose.
She says her mission now is to help save more lives.
My 20-year-old son Quintenn passed away on March 2 2021 from a fentanyl overdose Garton said.
There's not a day that goes by Garton said she doesn't think about her son.
Quintenn Clark played football and baseball. Garton said he was a good kid and never got into trouble.
This was until he was introduced to Xanax as a senior in high school.
He got kicked out of high school and... small colleges were looking at him for baseball. He lost all of the baseball. He couldn't join the military at that point Garton said.
Garton says her son was sober for a full year in January but she noticed that he was starting to act a little erratic by February.
It was that March day when she got the call that Clark wasn't breathing.
Clark joins a growing list of people killed from a fentanyl overdose. It's a synthetic opioid pain reliever that has been the main driver in the increased number of drug overdose deaths in Middle Tennessee.
Cheatham County where he lived had the highest in the whole entire state overdoses at the time said Garton.
The Cheatham County Sheriff's Office said so far this year there have been 11 deaths and more than 50 fentanyl overdoses.
Less than 60 miles east in Nashville nearly 80 of overdose-related toxicology reports in 2022 have detected fentanyl.
Just this week Metro Nashville Police Department released information that three men were found unresponsive from suspected fentanyl overdoses. Two men died.
Joshua Wolfe 34 of Elkhorn Nebraska and Karl Smith 25 of Lac la Biche Alberta Canada died. The survivor who was revived after being administered Naloxone is a 26-year-old friend of Wolfe and is also from Elkhorn Nebraska.
Detectives are reviewing downtown surveillance footage in an effort to determine who if anyone may have sold or given the victims an illicit drug. The surviving victim has met with detectives but said he does not remember what took place.
All we can do is continue continue continue to bring more awareness to this said Bruce Hill the founder of Recovery Warriors What Was Is No More a nonprofit organization helping those struggling with addiction. Hill said one time he was an addict and now he wants to help others.
If we don't get this back in our schools and start teaching these children what's going on We're not going to make it Hill said.
Hill would like to see Tennessee teach students the dangers of drugs as a curriculum.
As for Garton she has started the Quintenn Clark Foundationin memory of her son.
We started it with a thought that we could reach just one person just one person. Then his death wouldn't be in vain Garton said.
The foundations purpose is to provide resources for the treatment of addiction community awareness and support for families affected by addiction and education for drug abuse.

NASHVILLE Tenn.The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services TDMHSAS is encouraging all Tennesseans to look at the prescription medications in their homes and prepare to participate in National Prescription Drug Take Back Day this Saturday from 1000 a.m. to 200 p.m. local time.
National Prescription Drug Take Back Day is organized by the Drug Enforcement Administration to encourage the safe and secure disposal of potentially addictive and otherwise harmful prescription medications. In Tennessee community groups including the states Substance Use Prevention Coalitions team up with local law enforcement and other partners to host Take Back Day events. The events serve to collect thousands of pounds of medications while also providing opportunities to start conversations about preventing substance misuse and addiction.
Find a National Prescription Drug Take Back Day event near you at TNtogether.comtakebackday
It couldnt be easier to safely and securely dispose of the expired or unneeded prescription medications in your home. Just collect the medications youre ready to dispose bring them to an event and drop them offno questions asked said TDMHSAS Commissioner Marie Williams LCSW. By reducing the supply of potentially addictive medications and addressing the misuse of prescription pills before it starts were hopeful we can prevent deaths from substance use including fentanyl-laced counterfeit prescription pills.
Many people dont realize it but theft from medicine cabinets of family and friends is one of the most common and preventable forms of drug diversion said TBI Director David Rausch. This weekends event is a great opportunity for Tennesseans to take advantage of the numerous locations across the state to safely dispose of unwanted or expired household pharmaceuticals.
Prescription drugs that are not disposed of properly can end up in our waterways so DEA Take Back Day can have a positive effect both in terms of health and the environment said Commissioner David Salyers of the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation TDEC. This program helps in many ways and TDEC is proud to be part of it.
In the last National Prescription Drug Take Back Day in April of this year agencies collected more than 8200 pounds of medications at more than 120 locations across Tennessee. Since the start of Take Back Day Tennesseans have safely and securely disposed of more than 350000 pounds of medications.
Tennesseans who miss out on National Prescription Drug Take Back Day can still safely and securely dispose their medications at one of 383 permanent drug drop boxes across the state. These drop boxes are located in many pharmacies police precincts and sheriffs offices. Find a permanent drug drop box near you at this link tdeconline.tn.govrxtakeback
One of the largest obstacles for patients seeking effective substance abuse treatment is a lack of transportation to treatment facilities. Vanderbilt University researcher Janey Camp associate professor of civil and environmental engineering is working on a project to help clear those roadblocks.
Camp is leading an 18-month in-depth analysis of transportation investment opportunities that could help stem the opioid epidemic across Tennessee. The project is funded by the Tennessee Department of Transportation.
Tennessee has the third-highest opioid prescription rate in the nation and overdose deaths involving opioids in the state have been rising for more than a decade. Densely populated cities may offer the most transportation options to residents but even so public transit options are still no guarantee to accessible treatment. Camp explains that when applying this logic to rural areaswhich comprise nearly 93 percent of Tennesseeit is easy to understand the challenge of limited transportation options.
One of the most interesting pieces of the study for me will be when we review statewide data of substance abuse cases and different transportation options in those areas to see how travel time and cost modes of transport and location of treatment facilities intersect Camp said. She is collaborating on the research with Seth Guikema professor of industrial and operations engineering at the University of Michigan to assess currently available transportation and treatment options.
They will use the data to model a variety of scenarios that show how people can get to treatment facilities with improved transit options. From these models and other assessments the researchers will prioritize the transit optionspublic transit on-demand services such as ridesharing and infrastructurethat contribute most to mitigating the opioid epidemic.
Amid the COVID pandemic the researchers are also weighing how remote options like telehealth services are circumventing some issues related to transportation. People in recovery cannot rely solely on remote options Camp explained since many are required to submit biological samples on a regular basis. In addition data suggests that low income or rural patients may not have access to the technology or health care required to take advantage of telemedicine options.
We hope this project will help to make it easier for those in need of treatment to obtain the care they need and complete their treatment programs through innovative approaches to helping people gain access to treatment Guikema said.
Camp sees this project as a basis for new transportation design and implementation in Tennessee and other regions or states.
Growing up in rural Tennessee I have seen firsthand the challenges that result from lack of access to transportation and am looking forward to finding opportunities for change Camp said.

NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  Davidson County has the second highest overdose death rate in the country.
A new report by The San Francisco Chronicle looked at fatal overdoses across the country and found Davidson County was second only to Baltimore.
The report is from February 2022 to January 2023
Baltimore Maryland Davidson County Tennessee Philadelphia County Pa. Marion County Indiana Jefferson County Kentucky Washington D.C. San Francisco County California Shelby County Tennessee
Last year 754 people died from a drug overdose in Nashville according to the Metro Public Health Department. Fentanyl was the main driver in the increased number of drug overdose deaths. Other frequently detected substances in fatal drug overdose cases were meth and cocaine.
Virginia Sadler lost her grandson Jeremy Miller to fentanyl. The 80-year-old admits she didn't realize how powerful fentanyl is or how much of it is in our community until Miller died.
You can die immediately if it's in heroin or pills you take from somebody Sadler said. That was amazing to me that these pills that are out here and they look like everything else and they've got fentanyl and they kill you said Sadler.
Miller had just detoxed and completed treatment when he relapsed at a recovery house in Madison.
It's just so hard. I didn't go through it when I was growing up. I mean we didn't even know about drinking or any stuff like that... it was smoking and beer Sadler said.
Regional overdose prevention specialists with Nashville STARS told us that naloxone  the overdose reversal medication - is something everyone should carry. They say it's best to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it.
As for where someone is safest when they're recovering Andrea Hancock a peer counselor with STARS says a supportive living environment such as a recovery home or program. Those usually provide the support accountability and structure needed for someone who is in recovery.
All homes arent the same and all homes don't have the same guidelines. A family member or loved one should educate themselves on what options exist to find a safe place for a loved one to recover. That would include making visits and seeking referrals.
The state will receive that money over 15 years as part of the larger 17.3 billion in agreements that will be split between more than a dozen states.

NASHVILLE Tenn.  Tennessee will receive more than 400 million over 15 years after Walgreens CVS and two drug manufacturers agreed to finalize settlements to resolve lawsuits that alleged the companies contributed to the opioid crisis in the U.S.
The money will come from a much larger 17.3 billion in combined agreements involving more than a dozen states. Tennessee joined a broad coalition of states and thousands of local political subdivisions to reach settlements with five companies CVS Walgreens Walmart Allergan and Teva.
Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said a final agreement with Walmart hasn't been announced yet because of different processes for finalizing the settlement which he said is expected to happen in the coming weeks.
The four companies that finalized their agreements will also be required to follow certain rules as part of the settlement. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries is being required to halt any opioid marketing and ensure it has systems in place to prevent drug misuse. Drugmaker Allergan will be required to halt sales of opioids for the next 10 years.
CVS and Walgreens have agreed to require its pharmacies to monitor report and share data about suspicious activity with opioid prescriptions.
Skrmetti said the money is expected to start flowing to state and local governments by the end of 2023 which will be used to fund programs for things such as evidence-based opioid treatment and recovery services expanding overdose-reversal drug education for communities and preventing the over-prescription of opioids.
This court-ordered injunctive relief will help ensure a crisis like this does not happen again he said.
To date Skrmetti said Tennessee has received more than 1 billion from these opioid settlements.
In February the TOAC announced county governments would receive the first round of payments from the JansennJJ settlement agreements. 35 of the money is being paid out directly to counties in the form of opioid abatement trust funds while the remaining 65 will be distributed to communities through a competitive grant application process overseen by the TOAC. The state council said it is still trying to develop the application process for grants so it is not currently accepting any applications.

NASHVILLE Tenn. The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services is excited to welcome Mary Shelton as the Executive Director of Tennessees Opioid Abatement Council.
As Executive Director Shelton provides day-to-day leadership management and oversight for the functions of the Council directly supports Council members and will supervise Council staff. She was selected by a unanimous vote of the Councils membership at their first meeting on July 8 2022.
Tennessee's Opioid Abatement Council was created by the Tennessee General Assembly in Public Chapter 491 to manage the disbursement of proceeds from lawsuits relating to opioids. The Council upholds the responsibility to ensure the disbursements of these funds go toward funding programs strategies expenditures and other actions designed to prevent and address the misuse and abuse of opioid products and treat or mitigate opioid use or related disorders or other effects of the opioid epidemic.
We are so excited to have Mary Shelton join our team to lead this important new initiative. Her attention to detail organization and communication skills will be essential in ensuring that the Opioid Abatement Council is able to live up to its mission and get funding into Tennessee communities that have been so greatly harmed by the opioid crisis said TDMHSAS Commissioner Marie Williams LCSW.
I cant think of anyone who is better positioned than to lead in this work than Mary Shelton. What she brings from a Medicaid standpoint and understanding the issues and challenges that we face in the delivery of care to this population will exponentially increase our ability to improve the lives of people who have been touched by opioid addiction said Opioid Abatement Council Chair Stephen Loyd MD.
Shelton has significant experience in behavioral health working previously with TDMHSAS and most recently at TennCare managing mental health and substance use services for the states Medicaid beneficiaries. She is a 26-year state employee with an undergraduate degree from Tennessee Technological University a graduate degree from Trevecca Nazarene University and is currently pursuing a Master of Public Health at East Tennessee State University.

NASHVILLE Tenn.The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services is excited to expand a proven program for reversing drug overdoses and connecting patients to addiction treatment to more parts of the state. The U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Assistance is providing a 6000000 3-year grant to expand the program.
First Responder Resource Engagement Specialty Team FR-REST takes Tennessees extensive and successful history of naloxone training and distribution and targets first responders and law enforcement as the audience. FR-REST adds additional resources through care coordination and peer support provided by a person in recovery from substance use disorder.
The model was trialed in Tennessee starting in early 2020 with a grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration covering 14 counties in southern middle Tennessee. In its first year the program trained more than 2300 first responders and received nearly 600 referrals. About half of those referrals resulted in an admission to inpatient treatment and all referrals received recovery support and peer support services.

A private security group brought in by businesses downtown Solaren Risk Management are very concerned about the current fentanyl crisis.
They are not only worried about the public but the impact on first responders.
The CEO of Solaren Risk Management Jack Byrd says overdose deaths have increased more than 200 in the last five years in Tennessee and he says most of these cases include fentanyl.
The Metro Nashville Public Health Department says there have been a total of 1383 suspected overdoses since the beginning of 2023.
The health department adds there have been 103 suspected deadly drug overdoses so far this year and their spokesperson adds about 75 of the suspected overdose deaths have a fentanyl presence.
Byrd emphasizes this is a nationwide problem.
This is the single fastest growing epidemic as far as drugs go in the history that we ever tracked Byrd said
Byrd says it is a public safety concern and it is dangerous for first responders because a person that touches it or breathes it could succumb to its effects.
This fear now is unheard of. Just the amount of precautions that have to take place for officer safety Byrd explained.
Byrd adds the drugs are more potent and he explains they are administering more Narcan a medicine used to reverse an overdose more than ever.
Traditionally officers would carry one or two pouches of Narcan with them and we have cases now where people are using six seven eight just to sustain them Byrd said.
Monti Herring with STARS Nashville a local nonprofit that has mental health and substance abuse services says the best way to address this epidemic is more education.
Herring says he wants to see more businesses schools and non-profits taking advantage of their free training on drugs and overdoses.
The trainings that the state gives us covers a lot of different topics. Not just how to recognize or respond to an overdose and how to administer naloxone but it also talks about reducing stigma Herring said.
Herring emphasizes awareness is key and you can sign up for a free training through

The pregame pills took some of the pain out of Will Bell's hard-hitting high school football games  but it wasn't the linebacker's name on the prescription.
Bell was getting opioid-based painkillers  sometimes for free sometimes for a price  from a friend who suffered from a chronic disease.
They made me feel good. I didn't feel pain from tackling. I didn't feel pain from lifting Bell said.
As his friend's pain management regiment graduated from Vicodin to Percocet to hydrocodone to oxycodone so did Bell's. His use of the powerful drugs only escalated in college where aided by even better access to dealers he descended into addiction.
Bell now 26 eventually sought help and has found an incredible recovery community in Nashville the North Carolina native has been clean for 14 months.
For many of the millions of Americans caught in the growing scourge of opioid abuse the outcome is far worse. And few places have been hit harder than Tennessee.
The state said at least 1263 Tennesseans died from opioid overdose in 2014 the most recent figure available and one that points to rampant abuse misuse and addiction impacting millions of Tennesseans according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
For every one person who dies there are 851 people in various stages of misuse abuse and treatment according to the CDC. That's at least 1074813 Tennesseans or 1 in 6.
More people died in 2014 from opioid overdose than in car accidents in Tennessee.
As abuse and overdose reach unprecedented levels across the country prescription painkillers such as hydrocodone and oxycodone are the target of a growing number of federal state and industry initiatives.
Overprescription by providers is a gateway to addiction for many people who may turn to heroin as a cheaper high when caught in the throes of abuse.
The national spotlight on substance abuse and addiction is shining brighter as several federal agencies and institutions look for ways to curb the number of prescriptions as well as the quantity of prescribed pills while increasing access to treatment.
More than half  55 percent  of those who abuse painkillers get them from a friend or relative who has a prescription according to a 2014 report from the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services. Seventeen percent have their own prescription.
The CDC issued guidelines to address and reshape the prescribing habits of providers. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is requiring opioids to have black box warning labels on pill bottles as an additional measure to warn providers and patients of the potential risks.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday proposed to double the allowed number of patients a doctor can treat per month from 100 to 200 in what Dr. Darrell Arnett a Nashville-based pain management and addiction specialist called a huge bulletin of hope.
The moves come as part of a broader effort by the Obama administration to fight opioid abuse which began to spike about 20 years ago when controlling pain  also called the fifth vital sign  became a focus. A pilot study showed that while opioid use has grown patients' self-reported levels of satisfaction with pain control have not improved.
Too many pills dispensed
Tennessee has the second highest rate of prescriptions per person behind only West Virginia. Extra pills can be given away with good intentions  to help someone who has pain  or sold person to person in casual yet illegal trades.
A patient may get dozens for a broken bone or a chronic disease and then another amount at a follow-up a few weeks later. The person might become physically dependent or wind up giving them to acquaintances.
Many take a path similar to that of Bell who got started with pills from someone else's prescription before moving on to heroin.
Officials are trying to reduce the number of pills in medicine cabinets as well as increase awareness about the dangers of prescription narcotics.
People taking a Percocet from a friend or relative are not thinking 'One day I might end up on heroin.' We need to make people aware these are connected said Dr. David Reagan chief medical officer of the Tennessee Department of Health.
The state has been tracking opioid prescriptions for several years through its controlled substance monitoring database. Providers should check to see what a patient is taking before writing any controlled substance prescription.
There are 42835 people cleared as registrants  or those authorized to check patient history  to use the database as of 2015 up from about 14000 in 2010 according to a recent report from the Tennessee Department of Health to the legislature. There were 6.4 million patient reports requested the same year.
The number of providers and others designated to search the database continues to grow albeit at a slower pace than in previous years Reagan said. The number of queries also is growing In 2010 there was one search for every 14 prescriptions. In 2015 there was one search for every three prescriptions.
However one of the problems with the database is providers are not consistently using it Arnett said.
State and industry officials as well as providers say that the state would benefit from a national database or access to bordering state databases given how frequently people cross state lines to get a prescription.
Even with the database the state's overdose death rate has grown. The total for 2015 will not be available until midsummer and Reagan is not sure which way it's going to go.
Rethinking prescription habits
Changes to how some narcotics are prescribed  in 30-day prescriptions with no refills  are changing how doctors dispense medicine.
Dr. John Hale a doctor in Union City and the Tennessee Medical Association's president said taking away refills has been the best thing they've done to address the problem. Patients have to come back to get another round giving providers another opportunity to assess use and need.
It's also changing the size of prescriptions.
Data from BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee correspond with anecdotes that doctors are prescribing more tablets per prescription since the no-refill rule went into effect. Instead of 20 tablets with a refill a provider will prescribe 30 or 50 with no refill said Natalie Tate vice president of pharmacy management for BCBST in Chattanooga.
The number of paid claims for opioids from BCBST's commercial marketplace and Medicare Part D plans totaled 921439 in 2013. It jumped to 1068050 in 2014 which coincides with BCBST selling plans on the federally run exchange and in growth in Medicare plans. Total claims including refills then fell by 53525 or 5 percent in 2015.
The insurer's data on total units dispensed shows a 1.2 percent decrease from 67.4 million to 66.6 million from 2014 to 2015. In 2013 before adding some members there were 58.2 million units dispensed.
Tate said people may not know how to dispose of excess tablets or hoard and save for a rainy day.
People with excess medication can take it to police stations to turn it in without consequence. State health officials are working with some pharmacies to be drop-off points under a recent change in legislation.
Bell understands overprescription and the access he readily found to painkillers. He recalled in high school going back to the dentist three times after having his wisdom teeth removed and faking nausea from the pills to get another prescription.
In college he saw a provider for two years to get suboxone but alternately held onto the drug used to treat addiction as a backup for when he didn't have pills or heroin  or trading it on the street for drugs.
He dropped out when he stopped being a pretty functional addict and his life shattered into pieces. He knew he was physically addicted at 19.
Now clean for 14 months he's about to start the final two courses he needs to graduate with a degree in English and a minor in psychology. He's found solace and opportunity in painting.
It's been amazing to see the turnaround in my life Bell said. Addiction and recovery in the community is something that I've become passionate about.

Story highlights Max Barry died last month in Littleton Colorado Mayor says frank talk resources needed to fight epidemic
CNN 
Max Barry the 22-year-old son of Nashville Mayor Megan Barry died last month from an accidental drug overdose complicated in part by morbid obesity an autopsy report said Wednesday.
He had several drugs in his system at the time of his death including methadone THC cocaine alprazolam and hydromorphine according to the Jefferson County coroners report.
The report said he also had other health problems including hypertension fatty liver disease and fatty deposits in two of his major arteries and a reported history of prescription drug abuse with withdrawal symptoms.
Since her sons death on July 29 in Littleton Colorado Barry has spoken openly about his struggles with drugs saying that transparency may help others confront similar problems.
I cannot tell you how many people have come to me and shared their own grief stories about a loved one who died where they never talked about it before she told CNNs Jake Tapper in an interview on Tuesday. And I think that as a community we arent ever going to get in front of this epidemic if we arent actually having these kind of very frank conversations about whats killing our children.
Barry said that her son had gone to rehab last year.
He spent a month in rehab which was a great gift. We were able to make that happen for him and make it happen quickly because we had access to health care she said.
And actually that got him back on the right track she said. He went back to school. He graduated in his senior year this year and was headed to his next phase of life. He made a really stupid choice two Saturdays ago and its one he cant ever undo. 
Max Barry graduated from the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma Washington.
Asked about policies to treat drug addiction and combat the opioid crisis she mentioned the problem of overprescribing and the importance of a federal role in the fight. Barry spoke about her sons use of Xanax which is a trade name for alprazolam a drug used to treat anxiety.
She cited the importance of providing enough treatment beds and the need for first responders to be equipped with Narcan the brand name of naloxone  a drug used to help reverse overdoses.
We have to recognize that this is an epidemic and we have to make sure that those resources are out there she said.

Naloxone a life-saving drug used to reverse opioid overdoses may soon be as easy to get as Tylenol or aspirin. By summer 2023 naloxone could be available in vending machines supermarkets and convenience stores and as a result thousands of opioid-related overdose deaths could be averted.
In March 2023 the Food and Drug Administration approved naloxone nasal sprayalso known by the brand name Narcanfor sale over the counter or without a prescription. Higher dosages and some other forms of naloxone will still only be available with a prescription.
States have not had the authority to designate naloxone as an over-the-counter medication but have implemented workarounds such as statewide Standing Orders to make it easier to access. These workarounds however do not apply to organizations that purchase naloxone in bulk from drugmakers such as hospitals and harm-reduction groups. In settings such as these naloxone is treated as a prescription medication.
While most states have made naloxone available without a prescription it still must be obtained through a pharmacist. Making naloxone available over the counter will help combat the stigma associated with drug use by removing the need to obtain a prescription or talk to a pharmacist and eliminating fear or confusion around immunity laws for people prescribing dispensing and administering naloxone.
Drug overdose deaths reached a record 107000 deaths in 2021 with opioid-related overdose deaths accounting for nearly 81000 according to the Centers for Disease Control.
A 2017 National Institute on Drug Abuse statistical analysis found that higher rates of naloxone distribution among laypersonsanyone not a medical professionaland emergency personnel could prevent 21 of opioid overdose deaths. The study notes that most of the lives saved would be attributed to family friends and other laypersons having access to naloxone. The vast majority of naloxone doses are administered by emergency medical personnel.
Opioids attach themselves to the part of the brain that regulates breathing. When a person overdoses their breathing can be slowed or stopped eventually leading to death. Naloxone reverses overdoses by clearing the brain's receptors to which opioids were attached.
Naloxone has been found to be safe and effective in reversing overdoses even in infants with almost no potential for misuse or abuse. Equally as important as access is ease of use. Naloxone does not require medical training to administer.
Yet even with over-the-counter access the cost may still be a significant barrier for some people with Narcan retailing for as much as 60 for a single-use kit.
Stacker investigated the potential impact of over-the-counter naloxone on the opioid crisis in Tennessee using data from KFF and Legislative Analysis and Public Policy Association. Overdose death rate data is age-adjusted and was collected in 2021. Data about naloxone regulations was collected in January 2023.
Over-the-counter Naloxone and its potential impact on the opioid crisis in Tennessee
- All drug overdose death rate per 100000 56.6
--- Opioid drug overdose death rate per 100000 45.5
- Existing access to Naloxone without prescription statewide standing order
- Co-prescribing requirements may notify the patient about naloxone but not required to co-prescribe
- Immunity laws
--- For prescribers civil and professional immunity
--- For dispensers civil and professional immunity
--- For laypeople civil immunity only

Many of us know about opioid addiction through the lives and deaths of members of our families good friends or nearby neighbors. Its personal. And it hurts.
The hurt is growing. The number of fatal opioid overdoses in Tennessee continues to climb increasing from 89 in 2008 to 1304 deaths in 2018. The growth of the opioid epidemic has felt like a runaway train. Fortunately though the pace of the increase in opioid overdoses has started to slow. While this is not a treatment for the pain it does offer hope.
Two state policies helped
The slowing of the opioid death train is quite an accomplishment  and it reflects two key state policies. First the number and dosage of prescriptions for opioids is falling and by a lot. Americans received 247 million opioid prescriptions in 2013 which declined in each successive years to 191 million in 2017. The impact on Tennessee may be even greater after state legislators restricted opioid prescribing beginning in July 2018. The early impact appears promising.
Hear more Tennessee voicesGet the weekly opinion newsletter for insightful and thought-provoking columns.
Second state officials empowered all Tennesseans to respond to overdoses. Tennessee legislators voted to make Narcan the first-line overdose reversal agent available without a prescription  and also to provide Narcan through several public programs. The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services continues its invaluable effort to distribute Narcan to community groups across Tennessee and train all of us how to use it. Most emergency first responders now carry and all-too-frequently use Narcan the brand name for the nasal-spray application of naloxone. The Nashville Fire Department for example equipped all fire trucks and ambulances with Narcan two years ago.
Unexpected consequences
These two state policies saved lives. However they had several downstream effects. Many people struggling with addiction moved from prescription opioids to heroin fentanyl or methamphetamine. Thus the proportion of overdoses involving synthetic opioids in Tennessee increased from 39 of all opioid overdoses in 2015 to 58 in 2017. In addition the number of nonfatal overdoses has gone up. Locally the Nashville Fire Department reported treating 2260 residents with Narcan in 2019 a 28 annual increase in just 12 months.
Its not enough to keep people breathing and leave their addiction untreated but sadly treatment options in Tennessee are limited. Waiting lists for all forms of treatment particularly ongoing outpatient treatment are extensive and providers are few. This is deeply concerning as individuals with opioid addiction are more likely to be uninsured and without a clear source of care.
Building on recent successes Tennessee can increase access to treatment. We can expand availability of the recommended first-line treatment known as buprenorphine for those addicted to opioids. The experience nationally is positive with every other state now allowing nurse practitioners to prescribe buprenorphine. Tennessee legislators must follow suit and change state law by passing SB 1060. With the stroke of a pen we can make treatment much more widely accessible to those who need it. Many of us are waiting to increase that accessibility. Tennessee has numerous community health centers like ours at Neighborhood Health that provide care to those who need it regardless of their insurance status or ability to pay.
Im optimistic we can do this. We can do more than restore breath during an overdose we can provide life. As a pharmacist mother and grandmother its what I want for my family. Im sure its what Tennessee legislators want for theirs.

NASHVILLE Tenn.--The Tennessee legislature will decide on Thursday whether or not to remove a local judge from her post due to alleged substance abuse issues and a failure to comply with terms of her previous suspensions.
In a January  the Board of Judicial Conduct memo of removal recommendation centers around Judge A. Melissa Boyd who serves as a Criminal Court Judge in the 30th Judicial District in Shelby County.
According to the recommendation Judge Boyd has received two public reprimands since taking the role in September 2022. One reprimand cited from May 8 2023 states within weeks of Judge Boyd assuming office she solicited resources and cash donations on social media for the benefit of a third party. Judge Boyd is said to have ignored the Board's inquiry into the matter but agreed to accept the reprimand.
On May 22 2023 Judge Boyd was suspended following allegations from a campaign manager who also had personal relations with the judge. According to affidavits filed by the former campaign manager the woman claims she discovered a plate with a spoon and what is believed to have been cocaine in the Judge's home closet. The affidavit states Judge Boyd admitted it was cocaine to the campaign manager and also admitted to smoking marijuana multiple times since being elected.
The affidavits go on to allege Judge Boyd was also seen outside the campaign manager's property in January 2023 taking pictures of the woman's car and property which she then texted to the woman. The affidavit stated Judge Boyd allegedly sent more texts asking who is the whore seriously Judge Body also allegedly sent the woman pictures of her prior marriage license and information about her divorce which made the woman feel disturbed.
The Board memo adds following the suspensions the Board gave Judge Boyd an opportunity to resign in November of last year but did not respond nor had she addressed substance abuse issues. In December of last year Judge Boyd was indicted on charges of coercion of a witness and harassment. Judge Boyd responded she had ultimately entered a rehab facility after the specified required dates and accused the Board of piling on her by keeping her off the bench.
On Thursday the Joint Ad Hoc Committee of the legislature will consider if Judge Boyd should be removed.

Naloxone also known as Narcan is an anti-overdose drug.
While COVID-19 claimed hundreds of lives in Nashville last year drug overdoses killed even more people. Fatalities related to drugs spiked by nearly one-third compared to 2019 which was already a record year.
The numbers published this week are preliminary but the Metro Public Health Department says there were 619 fatal drug overdoses in Nashville last year. Thats up from 468 in 2019.
By comparison Davidson County still hasnt reached 619 reported COVID deaths. When the pandemic is under control public health officials will have to redouble their efforts on drug overdoses says Trevor Henderson the Nashvilles director of overdose response and prevention.
There is a vaccination for COVID. Hopefully we will come out the other side of that sooner rather than later he says. But when we come out from that. This is still here. This is very complicated. There is no vaccine.
There remains a stigma around the disease of addiction Henderson says even years into the opioid epidemic.
The largest age group dying from overdoses are in the prime of their lives between 25 and 44. Most of the deaths from 2020 roughly 80 were related to high-powered fentanyl which is a synthetic opioid that has become a popular street drug that often becomes deadly when its mixed with another drug. The user doesnt know how much theyve taken.
Henderson says theres a clear correlation between COVID and fatal overdoses with the first spike in the month of March and remaining elevated through July. Its unclear however whether the uptick was related to isolation financial stress or even people using powerful drugs alone rather than with someone else who could call for help.
The health department has mapped overdose deaths and 911 calls for help. The hot spots are in Madison and Antioch. But the biggest increase jumping 167 from 2019 to 2020 was the 37209 zip code which includes parts of Sylvan Park The Nations and the area surrounding Tennessee State University.
Overdose fatalities for the entire state are not yet available for 2020 and likely wont be until late summer. But theyre expected to set another record as is the national figure.
Officer Justin Franklin had just left the police station in Hermitage when his radio crackled to life. He rushed to the Old Hickory area where a woman was dying on her front porch.
The scene was so cliche it felt as if it had been ripped from a television screen. The woman was slumped on the porch steps eyelids drooped and barely breathing. On the ground by her side was a syringe a spoon and a dime bag. Relatives were weeping.
An ambulance has been called but nobody knew if it would arrive in time.
Franklin had been here before. Not on this porch or at this house but stuck in this moment. During five years with the Metro Nashville Police Department he had on a few occasions arrived at the scene of a drug overdose before ambulances or the fire department then realized there was little he could do to help. Each time he felt powerless. A badge and a gun meant nothing to an overdose.
But this time was different.
Franklin reached into a pocket on the front of his ballistic vest searching for an answer. Only 90 minutes beforehand his sergeant had issued him a package of nasal spray as part of a new program to stop overdoses. The spray is called Narcan and in a war on overdoses it is supposed to be a silver bullet.
Franklin ripped open the package and squirted the nasal spray into the womans left nostril. She didnt stir. Minutes ticked by and Franklins hope faded with each passing second. He wondered if maybe this woman was too far gone. Or maybe this miracle drug didnt work as well as advertised. Either way by the time the ambulance arrived Franklin felt defeated. He watched as medics loaded the womans limp lifeless body onto a stretcher.
And then she came back. The woman sat up abruptly wide-eyed then tried to jump off the stretcher as medics hoisted it into the ambulance. Yanked back from the brink of death she was confused agitated and even a little combative  but she was alive.
It felt good that what I did actually saved her life. Years before this she would have just laid there Franklin told The Tennessean. Before Narcan she likely would have died. There have been many times before like I said where we felt helpless.
This overdose rescue  occurring on Sept. 1 2017  was the first for the MNPD. The agency issued anti-overdose nasal spray to hundreds of patrol officers last summer and Metro cops have since used the nasal spray to reverse 14 potentially fatal overdoses according to police records reviewed by The Tennessean. The department has recorded only one incident in which an overdose victim was treated with Narcan but still died.
Rescues like these place the MNPD among a growing list of U.S. law enforcement agencies that have assumed a new role on the front lines of the opioid epidemic assisting with overdose treatments that have historically fallen to firefighters and medics.
This largely remains true in Nashville where the fire department administers Narcan about 50 times more often than cops but Metro police officers are now trained and equipped to become impromptu medics in the rare cases where they are the first on the scene of an opioid overdose.
OPIOIDSFor years heroin has been the deadliest drug in Nashville. Not anymore.
OVERDOSESSurgeon general Ask about Narcan  you might save a life
Narcan the brand name of naloxone is an inhalable or injectable drug that stops overdoses by temporarily binding the portions of the brain that normally receive opioids. Naloxone has virtually no effect on someone who has not taken opioids so the drug is not harmful if it is mistakenly given to someone who is not actually overdosing.
More than a thousand police departments across 40 states now carry Narcan according to the North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition which monitors the drug nationwide. A few sheriffs and police chiefs have publicly opposed their officers carrying the drug but the majority of law enforcement appear to have embraced Narcan as the newest tool on a modern cops heavy-duty belt.
Nashville is no different. In response to several years of rising overdose deaths Metro police spent 60000 last summer to buy 790 Narcan kits containing two doses of nasal spray each. Officer Franklin used his Narcan kit to save a life on the very first day they had been issued to patrol officers in his precinct. Since then Metro officers have use the drug to revive addicts at homes restaurants parking lots and street corners.
But rescues like these remain rare and 10 months after the Narcan kits were rolled out to police the vast majority have not been used. For this story The Tennessean interviewed three of the few officers who have used their Narcan all of whom said any reservations they had about the drug vanished as soon as they saw it in action.
Two of the cops described the drug as working like magic.
If you didnt know anything about Narcan you would think this was something fake said Lt. Doug Vinson who oversees Narcan kits in the East Nashville precinct. And it is made so easy and so foolproof its almost hard to mess up.
Vinson knows firsthand what the drug can do.
Last October Vinson was doing paperwork in his office in the East Nashville police station when he heard a shouting from the front of the station.
A pickup truck had come screeching into the parking lot parking sideways across two handicap parking spaces. A frantic man ran into the precinct shouting that his girlfriend had overdosed.
Vinson had a single package of Narcan on his desk waiting to be issued to a patrol officer the following day. The lieutenant grabbed it torn open the package and rushed into the parking lot.
Outside the truck door hung open and the young woman was sprawled across the cab. Her skin was as gray as a corpse. Vinson could see a drop of blood oozing out of a fresh prick in her arm.
Vinson pressed the Narcan to her nose and squeezed just like he had told so many younger officers to do when this situation eventually arrived. The woman snorted but did not wake. So Vinson waited a minute counting the seconds as the boyfriend paced then sprayed a second dose in her other nostril.
Immediately she sat up. It was like she had just been woken from a bad dream Vinson said. It was a relief that it worked and that it was obvious she was alive and going to make it.
And I think secondary to that I thought Wow this works exactly the way they told us in training.

Rookie Officer Jessica Johann was riding shotgun with her partner on Jan. 26 when they first spotted the white pickup truck weaving between traffic and speeding down the shoulder of Interstate 40.
They flipped on their lights and siren then Johann prepared herself for a chase. If the motorist was willing to drive like this she thought then he was probably willing to run.
The way he was driving the way he was weaving it seemed like intoxication or aggression Johann said. I knew it was something bad and I didnt think he was going to pull over for us.
A moment later the driver had surprised her. He had swerved to the side of the highway and slammed the brakes as if he was anxious to get pulled over. A man then jumped out of the truck shouting that his friend was having an overdose. They were driving to rehab the man said and his friend wanted one last high before he gave it up for good.
Johann rushed to the car to look inside. In the passenger seat a young man sat stiff with his eyelids drooped his chin tilted up and his mouth gaping open. His eyes were gray and his lips were turning blue. Every breath he took was a desperate gasp.
Johann signaled back to her patrol car telling her partner to call an ambulance. A moment later her partner was at her side with a Narcan kit. Johann thought back to her training tore open the package and sprayed a dose in one nostril.
Im sure it was only a minute but it felt like the longest minute ever Johann said describing the incident in detail for the first time. It didnt seem like the Narcan was helping  It was at that instant I thought maybe he would die before the paramedics could even get there.
Johann gave the man another dose.
A minute passed.
Then another.
His mouth closed and his eyes fluttered open. He lifted his head.
Hey Johann shouted caught by surprise. Dont ever do that again
The man looked at her confused as color seeped back into his face.
OK.

NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  The fight against opioid abuse continues and soon you'll see a form of overdose treatment at your drugstore. It's a big move that's causing both excitement and concern.
In Metro Nashville the number of deaths due to overdose has gone up every year since 2016. In the first half of 2023 332 people have died due to overdoses in the first half of this year. For the first time an opioid overdose blocker will be available over the counter as soon as next week.
The FDA approved the Narcan nasal spray for public use in March. According to data from Nashville.gov in 2022 and 2023 when someone has died due to an overdose over 75 of the time fentanyl was detected.
The second highest reported substance detected was cocaine at 42 for this year.
In early September you should start seeing it in the big retailers like a Walgreens and a Walmart. And as we go through the month of September access and availability of Narcan will continue to spread to regional grocery stores independent pharmacies and the like said Matt Hartwig with Emergent BioSolutions.
There is some concern about the price tag and whether people who need it can afford it.
A box will cost just under 50 and it'll include two doses.
'If it's going to be something if people don't have necessarily somebody in their immediate circle that they're concerned about. I think that 44.99 is pretty expensive said overdose awareness advocate Michelle Leopold.
In Nashville the Metro Public Health Department partnered with an organization called Partnership to End Addiction for an auto text program that sends you notifications about spikes in overdose activity in the county. It's free and anyone can sign up for it by texting SPIKE to 1 855 963-5669 855-9-OD-KNOW and following the prompts.

NASHVILLE Tenn.The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services TDMHSAS announced that its Regional Overdose Prevention Specialists ROPS distributed 35000 units of naloxone across the state from October 2017 to present. More than 14000 of the units were distributed directly to law enforcement.
The ROPS are regionally-focused community trainers who work in their assigned areas to educate people about substance use disorder opioid overdose and the use of naloxone. Since the program began in October 2017 ROPS have held 1450 trainings reaching more than 32000 people statewide. Trainings are targeted to people at risk of overdose community groups that interface with people at risk of overdose and first responders.
The only way to misuse naloxone is to not use naloxone. Its the only antidote to opioid overdose and it saves lives said TDMHSAS Commissioner Marie Williams LCSW. If we can prevent an opioid overdose from taking a persons life we can truly give them a second chance at seeing the hope that lies ahead in recovery from addiction.
The ROPS program has documented more than 2000 lives saved as a result of naloxone distributed through the program. The department believes the actual number of lives saved is higher than reported for a number of reasons including the stigma of addiction.
Because of the success weve seen with the ROPS and with new funding and support from our federal state and local partners weve recently increased the number of ROPS covering the state from 13 to 20 said Taryn Sloss TDMHSAS Assistant Commissioner for Substance Abuse Services.
Police are investigating after two men died and another was revived after a suspected drug overdose in in downtown Nashville early Tuesday morning.
All three were found unresponsive on 6th Avenue North just after 430 a.m. Tuesday the Metro Nashville Police Department said. Police identified the two who died as Joshua Wolfe 34 of Elkhorn Nebraska and Karl Smith 25 of Lac la Biche Alberta Canada.
A 26-year-old man who police said was Wolfe's friend and also from Elkhorn was revived after being given Naloxone. Naloxone is a medicine that can help reverse a drug overdose.
Investigators are looking into the possibility that fentanyl was involved and working to identify where the men got the drugs MNPD said. The man who survived told detectives he does not remember what happened.
Downtown surveillance footage is also being reviewed police said.

Xylazine or tranq is a horse tranquilizer that's being mixed with street drugs the TBI said.

Example video title will go here for this video
KNOXVILLE Tenn.  Overdose deaths involving the drug tranq rose to a new high across East Tennessee for the first time the Knox County Regional Forensic Center said. Across the center's 21 counties 106 people who died of overdoses had tranq or Xylazine in their bodies  over the first nine months of this year.
Xylazine is legal for use by veterinarians as a tranquilizer for animals. The Drug Enforcement Agency said it's used as an adulterantwhich means it's mixed with other drugs like heroin or fentanyl to reduce the amount of money drug makers have to spend on a mixture and increase their profits.
Xylazine is sometimes called the Zombie Drug because it slows brain activity breathing and heart rates. Those who inject the drug are at risk of amputation thanks to disfiguring sores.
In Knox County Xylazine contributed to 67 drug-related deaths from Jan. 1 to Sept. 30. The county reported its first Xylazine-related death in 2018.
It's not just came in it's trying to take over said Chris Thomas the Knox County Regional Forensic Center Director.
The graph below shows how quickly tranq-related deaths grew across the Regional Forensic Center's 21 counties.
We're not talking about drugs. We're talking about poisons now said Tommy Farmer the Tennessee Dangerous Drugs Task Force Director. It's not a matter of 'Does my fentanyl have xylazine in it' It's a matter of 'Yes it does have Xylazine in it.'
Federal drug investigators also said Xylazine can prolong a user's high.
If there's something they can get their hands on that's cheap that can intensify the high or the effects or even stretch the amount of drugs Farmer said. Those are going to be ways that they can increase their profit margin.

Dr. Darrel Rinehart had 5 patients die of drug overdoses under his care in 11 months.
Prosecutors indicted Rinehart in March after a Tennessean investigation.
Rinehart intends to plead guilty to at least one drug crime next month.
A longtime Tennessee doctor who had five patients die of fatal overdoses in less than a year intends to plead guilty to a federal drug crime.
Dr. Darrel Rinehart 64 who ran a clinic in Columbia for decades was indicted on 19 counts of distribution of a control substance in March. His attorneys last week filed a motion asking for a court hearing in December at which intends to plead guilty.
One of Rineharts attorneys James Simmons said Monday that Rinehart would confess to at least one count of drug distribution. Simmons said the decision to plead guilty came after Rineharts legal team examined the discovery provided by prosecutors but declined to speak in detail about the case.
Obviously he wouldnt be entering a plea if we didnt feel that was an appropriate resolution to the case Simmons said.
The U.S. Attorney's Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The federal indictment against Rinehart states that he routinely prescribed opioids and other drugs without legitimate medical purpose and that four patients died while in his care.
In January Rinehart was also the subject of a joint investigation by The Tennessean and The Indianapolis Star. State health records showed at least five of Rineharts patients suffered fatal overdoses that were partially or wholly caused by drugs he prescribed between March 2015 and January 2016. At least six more Rinehart patients had nonfatal overdoses between 2014 and 2016 and one of those patients overdosed three times state health records showed.
When asked to defend his prescriptions to state health officials Rinehart said he was ignorant of safe prescribing law and too trusting of his patients.
You always want to do what you could to help people Rinehart told a state medical board. And yes sometimes people tell you things you believe them you trust them you know them but you know theyre not always honest.  That certainly has altered the way I practice medicine now.
Rinehart worked for at least two decades at Core Physicians also known as Family Health Group a clinic in Columbia Tennessee. The clinic was purchased by Maury Regional Hospital in 2015 and the new owners were among the first to take issue with Rinehart's prescriptions.
After his prescriptions were questioned Rinehart relocated to Indiana and worked at least two hospitals. The Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners agreed to suspend but not revoke Rineharts medical license if he agreed not to attempt to practice medicine in Tennessee ever again.
Rinehart was also criminally investigated by police and prosecutors in Maury County who used an informant to capture undercover video footage inside his clinic. But the local case never reached prosecution.
Maury County District Attorney Brent Cooper said earlier this year that his office intended to charge Rinehart with five counts of criminal homicide but instead gave the case to prosecutors at the U.S. Attorney's Office who became interested in Rinehart after reading about him in The Tennessean.
Cooper said he believed federal prosecutors could pursue a stronger case with harsher punishment.
People in this area hold doctors in very high esteem Cooper said. I think convincing 12 citizens beyond a reasonable doubt that what Dr. Rinehart did amounts to reckless homicide would have some difficulties. But I dont think it would be impossible and we were certainly going to try if the federal authorities had not reached out to us first.

Four days after Greg Witthauer went missing his parents got a phone call from a Metro Nashville Police Department chaplain.
Witthauer's body had been found.
His father Mark Witthauer had planned his son's funeral dozens of times in his mind during his 10-year addiction that ended with heroin and prescription painkillers. But he still wasn't ready for that call.
Mark Witthauer and his wife Karen were grateful that at the very least they could identify their son by describing his tattoos over the phone without having to see his body which was discovered in the passenger seat of his car parked near Percy Priest Lake. Police believe his body was moved from another location.
He was 23.
An only child Greg Witthauer grew up in a quiet neighborhood in Franklin playing soccer on a travel team and skateboarding in his spare time.
But Tennessee's wealthiest county isn't immune to the devastation of the ongoing opioid crisis. Twenty-seven people in Williamson County died in 2017 from overdoses including from drugs such as fentanyl and heroin.
From 2012 to 2016 there have been 10.3 drug overdose deaths per 100000 people in Williamson County according to data from the Sycamore Institute a nonpartisan public policy research center.
That's about one person every 17 days.
Greg Witthauer's addiction started when he was a teenager. And no matter where he went to school  he transferred from Centennial to Brentwood High to Middle College now known as Renaissance High  he could always find drugs his parents said.
The Witthauers' story contains chapters relatable to many families with loved ones in active addiction A home that feels more like a war zone. Valuables that go missing. Hidden syringes and needles.
In the 10 years Greg Witthauer used drugs he went to rehab nine times beginning at 15.
He started smoking marijuana as a high school freshman then moved up to benzodiazepines typically prescribed for anxiety then to cocaine then to prescription painkillers.
He was always looking for something to make him feel normal his mother said.
When compared to the rest of Tennessee it can look like Williamson County hasn't been touched by the opioid epidemic.
Out of 1186 opioid overdose deaths in Tennessee in 2016 Williamson County had 26. Davidson County had 248.
But families who have lost their children and loved ones in Williamson County tell a different story.
'They still don't think it's affecting them'
More than 200 people attended a forum at Our Savior Lutheran Church earlier this month organized by the Witthauers and Liz and Yarnell Beatty a Brentwood couple who lost their son Alex to an overdose in 2016.
The forum Breaking the Silence featured addiction and recovery professionals including Dr. Stephen Loyd the former medical director for Tennessee's substance abuse services division. Loyd resigned from that position in February to accept the role of co-medical director at JourneyPure at the River a private drug rehab center in Murfreesboro.
Loyd said the single largest problem with addressing addiction isn't a lack of money resources or access to treatment.
It's the social stigma he said that keeps people from seeking treatment and families from getting the support they need when a loved one is struggling with addiction.
Loyd likens it to the stigma borne out of the HIV and AIDS epidemic in the 1980s when that diagnosis was considered a death sentence.
Addiction particularly the opioid epidemic is this generation's HIV and AIDS epidemic Loyd said. You can have all the resources in the world but if you don't have people ready to step out and ask for help it doesn't matter.
Tricia Benitez a treatment specialist with Addiction Campuses is often the first point of contact for people who decide to enter recovery.
She visits Williamson Medical Center regularly to touch base with staffers who treat overdose patients. But those employees say some patients deny having a problem even after an overdose Benitez said.
They say these people still don't think they have a problem. They still don't think it's affecting them because of their status quo location Benitez said. We're trying to make sure they understand the devastation of what's happening in our own backyard. If we continuously just brush it under the rug ... nothing's going to get done.
Williamson Medical Center declined to comment for this story.
'Things are getting deadlier quicker'
Dean Porterfield is the director of adolescent programs at Cumberland Heights in Nashville a nonprofit alcohol and drug addiction recovery center. He also runs a counseling practice.
The main demographic Porterfield serves are young white men usually from affluent families.
The one thing these adolescents are searching for is purpose  a place to belong. A lot of times with that lifestyle of comfort and ease you've also taken away that young person's purpose to fit in he said.
While dismissing teens' drug use as just a phase may have worked in the past Porterfield said the emergence of deadly drugs such as fentanyl can be fatal for people experimenting with drugs.
Some kids experiment but I think now ... that's kind of gone away because things are getting deadlier quicker he said.
While parents want the best for their children Porterfield said raising kids in affluent homes with little responsibility can sometimes backfire especially if they're not held accountable for their actions.
These families have the means to kind of bail their kids out frequently. The more you bail them out the more it reinforces their behavior because they don't suffer the consequences. That tends to escalate.
But treatment doesn't look the same for someone with a full-blown addiction as it does for someone dabbling with certain drugs he said. Treatment can range from inpatient and sober living facilities to intensive outpatient care or counseling.
It's hard to say what rock bottom is for a lot of these kids because that could be death he said. All I ask kids to do is to admit they abuse substances  that's easier for them to wrap their head around. Not all these kids will go out and have a full-blown addiction.
Cumberland Heights has two outpatient centers in Williamson County  one that recently opened in Spring Hill that treats adults and an adolescent outpatient program in Cool Springs.
When looking at treating kids its important that we treat the whole family and make them part of the process Porterfield said.
More resources needed
At one point Greg Witthauer had 20 months of sobriety. He was on probation related to theft charges and was participating in the 21st District Recovery Court in Williamson County.
After injuring his back at work Greg Witthauer saw a doctor in Nashville and told him he was an addict and in drug court.
The doctor prescribed him painkillers anyway the Witthauers said. Then he relapsed.
The doctor gave him 10 pills and that was all it took Karen Witthauer said through tears. He would say 'Mom every day it just eats at me.' 
Jeff Long worked as an assistant district attorney in the 21st Judicial District before he was first elected as Williamson County sheriff in 2008. He's familiar with the migration of the state's opioid crisis which started with prescription painkillers then heroin in East Tennessee and worked its way west.
The 21st Recovery Court is one option for some nonviolent offenders charged with a felony in Williamson County. The two-year court-supervised recovery program offers alternative sentencing for people whose offenses are a result of illegal drug use.
Long said the Recovery Court is a valuable asset for Williamson County's court system but added that treating underlying mental health issues in defendants is equally important.
We're trying to develop a program where both the mental health aspects and drug addiction is treated at the same time Long said. You can't treat one without the other.
Recovery Court Director Connie Martin said the program has roughly 30 participants at any given time and about 20 more who may be in long-term inpatient treatment.
Participants must follow strict requirements such as maintaining employment attending monthly court dates and taking a drug test three times a week. About 50 percent don't complete the program Martin said.
While the program accepts people from Williamson Hickman Lewis and Perry counties roughly 70 percent of its participants are from Williamson County.
Recovery Court also helps participants find housing and food through partnerships with other local nonprofits and provides medical and psychiatric care through third parties  all on an annual budget around 400000 Martin said.
You'd think from one of the most affluent counties in the state resources would be plentiful here but they're not she said.
Our dream is to one day have a residential facility like DC4 she said referring to the Davidson County Drug Court Residential Program which has its own inpatient treatment facility. Martin knows it's a lofty goal but said she won't give up as long as she's the Recovery Court director.
Addiction in Williamson County By the numbers
Williamson County had 26 drug overdose deaths in 2016.
In 2015 the county had 265 nonfatal overdose outpatient visits and 116 nonfatal overdose inpatient stays.
More than 42500 people received opioids for pain in the county last year down slightly from 44800 people in 2016.
Nearly 121000 opioid prescriptions were filled in the county last year.
The three opioids most commonly prescribed in the county last year were short-acting hydrocodone short-acting oxycodone and short-acting Tramadol.
Between 2013 and 2017 the number of prescriptions filled in the county for short-acting Tramadol increased more than 15 percent.

1 FAMILY 3 DEATHS Couple must pick up pieces  again  after opioids' destruction
NASHVILLE Tenn.The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services TDMHSAS and Department of Health today issued new guidance and information around fentanyl and what to do in case of a potential exposure.
Recent media reports have highlighted stories of exposure to a white powdery substance assumed to be fentanyl and the wide variety of adverse medical reactions that followed. While these stories are disturbing it is important for everyone involved to separate fact from fiction when talking about fentanyl exposure to avoid unnecessary confusion and panic.
Illicit fentanyl cannot be absorbed through the skin or by touching an item or surface where it is present. When in powder form fentanyl and its analogs including carfentanil and fluorofentanyl cannot be absorbed through the skin. Dissolving the powder in a liquid does not change this property. Wet objects do not pose an increased risk for an overdose caused by casual exposure.
Its so important to separate fact from fiction when it comes to fentanyl because Tennesseans are dying of overdose by the thousands. It is our hope that these facts will help people who are struggling with opioid use reach to treatment if they need it and find a new life in recovery said TDMHSAS Commissioner Marie Williams LCSW.
Overdoses are heart-wrenching for those who live through them and for the family and friends of those who dont said TDH Commissioner Dr. Morgan McDonald MD FACP FAAP. We are taking every opportunity to provide care and information to those dealing with addiction to prevent deaths and overdoses from fentanyl and opioids.
What should you do if you believe you have been exposed to a substance that could be fentanyl
Do not touch your eyes nose or mouth.
Wash your hands with soap and water to remove any substance from your hands.
If you begin to experience any adverse medical symptoms seek medical attention.
Symptoms of opioidfentanyl overdose include pinpoint pupils falling asleep or losing consciousness slow and shallow breathing choking or gurgling sounds limp body and pale blue or cold skin. If you suspect an overdose call 911 and administer naloxone Narcan if available. Do not leave the person alone.
Symptoms such as alertness rapid heartbeat hyperventilating sweating chills numbness in fingers are NOT typically associated with opioidfentanyl overdoses though they may need medical attention. These symptoms are more commonly associated with anxiety or a panic attack.
For a fentanyl overdose to occur the powder must enter the bloodstream and get to the brain. This is why it is important to avoid touching your eyes nose or mouth until you can wash your hands. Fentanyl can also enter the bloodstream through cuts or wounds on the skin. Wounds must be open and visible to allow fentanyl to enter.
Prescription fentanyl transdermal patches dispensed by a licensed pharmacist are especially formulated to include other pharmaceutical ingredients designed to increase the permeability of the skin which allows a small amount of fentanyl to be absorbed very slowly. Full absorption of fentanyl through a patch takes 3-13 hours. Proper disposal of patches reduces the risk of ingestion by children and pets.
To learn more about fentanyl overdose reversal and how to save a life with naloxone please reach out to the Regional Overdose Prevention Specialist who serves your area. Additionally you can find recorded trainings and information about fentanyl on our website at this link TN.govbehavioral-healthfentanyl.

Max Barry son of Nashville Mayor Megan Barry died from a combination of several drugs including opioids according to an autopsy report released Wednesday by the Jefferson County Coroner's Office in Colorado.
Drugs found in Max Barry following his death were Xanax marijuana and two opioids  liquid methodone and hydromorphone. The autopsy also showed that he had recently used cocaine.
Max Barry 22 died at a home that a friend was housesitting on Saturday July 29 in Littleton Colo. a suburb of Denver where he had moved after college. He was there with two friends.
The toxicology findings confirm what the mayor called an apparent overdose immediately after his death. She had speculated that her son was killed by a combination of a drugs including Xanax.
There was no alcohol present in Max Barry after his death according to the autopsy report. Contributing factors to his death were hypertension and obesity.
The mayor and husband Bruce Barry have chosen to be transparent about the death of their only child to become a voice in the growing national opioid crisis. Max Barry had past struggles with drug addiction and enrolled in a drug rehab facility last summer for one month.
The mayor after returning to work Monday and discussing the tragedy with local media has been on a national media swing this week to discuss opioids and her son's battle with drugs.
She appeared on CNN with Jake Tapper and PBS NewsHour on Tuesday and on MSNBC's Meet The Press Daily with Chuck Todd and NBC Nightly News on Wednesday.

NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  It's an animal tranquilizer now being found in illicit drugs.
Xylazine is a veterinary sedative or a veterinary tranquilizer Dr. Josh Schrecker senior director of clinical affairs at Aegis Sciences Corporation.
Known as 'tranq' the drug is being detected in opioid supplies like fentanyl across the country. According to a White House press release xylazine-positive overdose deaths increased by 1127 in the South 750 in the west more than 500 in the Midwest and more than 100 in the northeast between 2020 and 2021.
So if you get a certain amount of a prescription opioid or an illicit opioid adding an adulterant to that drug may allow you to expand your supply while also retaining some of the effects that an end user may be wanting when they're buying that drug said Schrecker.
But unlike opioids Xylazine can't be reversed by Naloxone.
It acts on a totally different receptor site than a prescription or an illicit opioid said Schrecker.
Aegis began expanding testing for drugs like xylazine about a year ago. Since then positivity rates have increased  so has demand for testing.
So providers are utilizing our test results to understand what sort of exposure or use has occurred in that individual to better make decisions going forward as to how to appropriately treat that person Schrecker said.
As one of the only labs that offers this kind of testing Aegis tests about 4000 samples a month that are shipped throughout the country.
But as with most trends Schrecker said the drug supply may change.
So in six months eight months 12 months we're likely going to be dealing with a different drug that has different effects. We need to be prepared for that.
Despite modest numbers in Nashville deadly overdoses connected to 'tranq' are on the rise. In 2019 xylazine was detected in six fatal overdoses. By 2022 the drug was detected in 40 deadly overdoses.
NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  Drug overdoses are on the rise across the country and theyre largely driven by fentanyl.
According to the Metro Nashville Public Health Department in the first quarter of this year there were 173 suspected drug overdose deaths that occurred in Davidson County.
The data revealed 79 of those cases detected fentanyl.
Tuesday evening the founder of The Romello Marchman Foundation Tanja Jacobs will give a presentation to council-members to really take a deeper dive into what the fentanyl epidemic is and the importance of spreading awareness.
The CDC reports drugs may contain deadly levels of fentanyl and its nearly impossible to tell if drugs like cocaine are laced with it.
The rise in overdoses motivates her to share the story of her son Romello Marchman who died of fentanyl poisoning in 2020.
She thinks of these deaths as murder and not overdoses.
Kids are stressed. They don't always tell parents everything about how they feel. They go to a friend that has a pill and in this pill could very well be laced with fentanyl Jacobs said. Sadly kids die and then the parents find them dead the next day.
Jacobs will be sharing her story with council members and will be joined by Former Nashville Mayor Megan Barry for the presentation. Her son died of an overdose in 2017.
I can't even stress enough how important it is to meet her personally from a mother to a mother she said. This is the first time I will meet her and I'm looking forward to it. I really hope that she is willing and able to help us connect with people.
Jacobs plans to keep growing the foundation and host more awareness events.

It's almost like a movie set The room is a warehouse with a judicial bench and courtroom walls erected at one side. Commanding a wood podium in front of a state seal is Nashville Criminal Court Judge Seth Norman and he's talking about coining out.
The term that means nothing to you means everything to those in the room real people working to stop their addictions. Norman reads a name Matthew Lipps. As if it's a cue. In an instant the silence in the room transforms chairs push back  their metal legs scraping the cement floor  the men bellow and everyone claps.
Lipps 34 has made it.
He was hooked on alcohol and pills. Now he gets to live somewhere else outside of the treatment facility guarded by rigid rules not fences that he's called home and hell for 14 months. He has coined out.
It's been a long road he said. I've learned a lot of things. ... I've been doing drugs since I was 8 years old. I look at the world a different way today than I did.
Norman began his treatment court in 1995. It was the first in the state. Now there are 68 recovery court programs in Tennessee that provide addiction services to adults.
That number has exploded since 2013 when there were 33 courts. In 2012 Gov. Bill Haslam shifted funding and oversight of the recovery courts to the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services and directed the department to make those programs available to people in all 95 counties. That remains a work in progress.
More than 1600 people participated in the court programs statewide in the last full fiscal year according to Marie Crosson executive director of the Tennessee Association for Drug Court Professionals.
Addiction doesn't get solved by simple jail time or punishment of crimes she said. In order to stop the ongoing process of repeat offenses we've got to treat the problem where it is. That's treating the addiction.
Right now in Tennessee that addiction is opioids.
Between 300 and 400 people each year who come into the court programs say that is their drug of choice according to Ellen Abbott director of criminal justice services for the state.

About 75 percent of participants in Norman's court have used opioids or heroin which provides a similar high to pills but is cheaper though it may not be the person's primary addiction leaders say. Abbott said in 2016 208 recovery court participants were primarily addicted to heroin. Two years earlier it was only 94 people.
Norman and Crosson say there is need to expand the programs into rural areas which can have fewer community-based resources such as inpatient treatment providers. Norman's court in Nashville is the only one in the state that provides its own housing. Others turn to community resources. There also is a need to reach more women I really do have people calling me every day begging for beds Norman said.
Statewide recovery court participants spend 12 to 24 months in a program. Norman says that's often years shorter than a prison term and it's cheaper than incarceration when considering daily housing costs. The judge estimates 33000 savings by sending a person through his program.
There are no fences with barbed wire or cells at Davidson County Drug Court. Just long-term treatment that despite a laundry list of strict rules participants believe is helping them beat addiction.
Or as 23-year-old David Faust says helping him learn to feel emotion without turning to substances. He and others in the program want the public to know that this is not a life they chose nor could stop.
When people are kids they don't just grow up and say 'I want to grow up and be a heroin addict'  Faust said.
His addiction started in high school. I ended up smoking a bunch of pot taking pills he said. I started taking stronger pain pills it's like a progression you know. Eventually I started shooting up pills. It was getting pretty expensive and heroin's pretty cheap so it just makes sense to go to heroin.
He worked and lived in Nashville.
It wasn't ever enough money to support my habits. I had to do extra stuff he says. Extra stuff like breaking into houses and cars according to public records.
I've been to a bunch of rehabs before this one he says. But they were like 28-day rehabs. That's no real clean time or anything. So I'd just get out and keep doing the same thing.
He started in drug court in September 2015 when his lawyers presented an ultimatum drug court or prison.
Jail's a lot easier he says. The residential program is strict Men and women do not interact. They work in the kitchen and garden. If someone doesn't do chores their dorm mates can be punished. Often that's a sentence to wear an old-fashioned black-and-white-striped jail jumpsuit.
But it works.
It's probably the worst best thing that's happened to me Faust says.
Around here you really find out what pisses you off. You learn to deal with that in the form of not getting messed up. You also learn what makes you happy.

He took life for granted.
And then his lifestyle was taken away.
Now Stephen Staley 24 is being held behind bars for drug and other offenses. He wrote me a letter from his current home DC-4 in Davidson County Drug Court to express his regret and to publicly declare he is a changed man.
March 9 he wrote marked the day he had been clean of all my substance abuse for one year.
Staley said he wrote to me after reading the column I wrote about Christine French Cully the editor of Highlights magazine. Her late husband's motto was It's a great day to be alive.
That line caught his eye. So he penned me a letter.
Last week's columnKelly Clarkson gives Nashville teacher 10K for Ukranian refugees after story appeared in this column  The Type Set
I wrote him back about my own father who was in his earlier life a heroin addict who did time in a federal institution. My father who died in 2013 did his best to shake the demons that had haunted him as a young man. It was a struggle for him.
I hope Staley understood my message There is always a chance to turn your life around.
Maybe the saddest thing Staley wrote was that he felt given up on ... not just by loved ones and friends but God and society as a whole. He went on I've been viewed as a villain for so long.
One's world view doesn't get much darker than those two sentences.
Staley grew up in Cleveland Tennessee.
At 12 years old Staley saw his father smoking methamphetamine and instead of being horrified he thought it was the coolest thing. He didn't start using then but he filed his curiosity away.
It would come back later with a vengeance.
He said he started using alcohol and marijuana at 16. Drug use was followed by shoplifting. He was caught trying to steal an auxiliary cord for his car stereo from Walmart.
At 18 Staley tried amphetamines. And soon found himself surrounded by people who were hooked.
At 19 he was arrested for driving under the influence. And it wasn't long before his old curiosity caught up with him. He tried meth. Within seven months he was an intravenous meth user.
One low point Staley will never forget is when he stole his mother's wedding ring and let her think the she had lost it.
Criminal charges piled up Theft possession drug manufacture resale delivery. He was facing 18 years in prison when he was given a second chance. The court allowed him to try to get clean in a drug rehabilitation facility in Arizona.
I thought I had my addiction beat he wrote. I thought because I had God on my side I couldn't fail.
More importantly I thought I could still have one drink.
One drink turned into a needle in his arm. Thirteen months of rehab was gone in an instant.
It was during this time while he was blowing his second chance that he met a woman named Denise. She was not a user.
For some reason she wanted to help me he wrote. Til this day I don't understand why.
On March 9 2021 Staley was arrested again for theft.
He contemplated suicide. I was ready to end it he wrote. It seemed like an easier option. No one would miss or even recognize me gone.
He was given a second second chance  18 to 24 months in DC-4 in Nashville.
Uplifting storyThe tragic reason this Middle Tennessee couple leaves huge tips at area restaurants  The Type Set
Most importantly Denise promised she would hold his hand wherever he went. And maybe that promise is what saved him. His mother has also been there to support him as he tries to stay sober.
Staley is approaching the halfway mark of his sentence and Staley wrote he is the happiest I've been in 20 years. He will start a work-experience program and then live in a halfway house.
I hit my rock bottom and I'm climbing slowly back to the top he wrote.
Staley is in a 12-step program. As he wrote to me he was in his third step which involved turning his life over to a higher power.
Staley is dreaming about the day he is free. He dreams about being a good man for Denise and her three boys. He dreams of reconnecting with family and friends.
In February Staley revealed to his mother that he had stole her wedding ring.
A weight lifted off my shoulders he wrote. She forgave me.
Staley has another very specific dream. When he is free he was to operate a food truck called Uncle Bud's featuring bakery goods.
I will succeed he wrote. One day at a time.

NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  The family of a toddler who died of fentanyl poisoning is now suing the Nashville facility where she was found.
The Community Care Foundation manages Highroads Place in Nashville and both are listed as defendants in the lawsuit filed by the grandfather of Ariel Rose.
The Rose family is now seeking 15 million in damages.
Ariel was 22 months old when she was found unresponsive at Highroads Place last November.
Her father was staying at the transition home at the time but says he left the toddler in the care of a Jane Doe for one night.
Metro Nashville Police said thats when Ariel was exposed to fentanyl and died of fentanyl poisoning.
An autopsy report showed Ariel had enough fentanyl in her system to kill multiple adults.
Although Jane Doe is listed as a defendant in the lawsuit attorneys say that the Rose family believes Highroads Place shares in the liability.
According to the lawsuit there were more than 145 calls made to Metro Nashville Police between January 2022 and when Ariel died in November of that year.
Attorney Isaac Kimes said most of these calls involved drug abuse of some kind and some were fatal.
We highlighted the fact that there had been more than 100 calls made to this facility. Many of those calls dealing with calls and not just that but there were actually dead bodies found in the facility dealing with drug overdosebefore Ariel ever stepped foot at Highway Kimes said.
Highroad Place serves as a transition home for people trying to get back on their feet from any number of things.
In the case of Ariel and her father both had been living in the now-former Brookmeade homeless encampment.
Thats where many first learned about the toddler who was spotted by police on one occasion living in a tent just feet from an exposed syringe.
Ariel later moved in with her aunt but was eventually reunited with her father at Highroads Place.
The lawsuit claims that the Community Care Fellowship knew people were using drugs in their residences.
The lawsuit goes on to say the defendants should have known about drugs circulating through their facility but the family believes they did nothing to stop it.
When asked about any liability shared by the family for leaving Ariel in the care of someone with a known history of drug abuse attorneys said that the family wants those who facilitate the drug use held responsible.
We want to be preventing those situations from happening. We have an opioid epidemic across the country that we all know about. In this situation that epidemic made its way into a place where drugs are not supposed to be Kimes said.
Community Care Fellowship sent us the following statement
We send our sincerest sympathies and condolences to the family. As this is an ongoing legal matter were not in a position to publicly comment on specific details related to the complaint. CCF has cooperated with police authorities in their investigation of this matter. We will engage in the legal process to address the civil complaint being made against our organization.
Metro Nashville Police have ruled Ariels death as negligent homicide but no one has been arrested.
Companies that made distributed or sold opioid painkillers faced lawsuits that led to a 26 billion settlement. In 2022 local governments across the country  including in Tennessee  signed on to the settlement agreement and now its up to the affected communities to decide how they will best mitigate the damage those companies caused.
In 2023 more than 700 Nashvillians died from a drug overdose.
In March of this year the Tennessee Opioid Abatement Council announced 81 million in grant awards statewide with millions set to hit Nashville organizations bank accounts starting in July.
There are a few common threads in the program strategies. Medication-assisted treatment with buprenorphine and methadone curbs opioid cravings. It is used to treat opioid use disorder shortened to OUD and substance use disorder SUD a broader term. Naloxone commonly known by the brand name Narcan can reverse an overdose but not if xylazine an adulterant often found in illicit drugs is involved. Many organizations will operate under the harm-reduction ethos which acknowledges that people will not typically be ready to quit using drugs altogether but when provided with clean syringes wound care and naloxone they can more likely live to one day access treatment.
Below find more details on how Nashvilles top five awardees plan to spend the opioid-abatement money.
Vanderbilt University Medical Center 2.8 million
VUMCs funding will focus on treatment for mothers with substance use disorder and their babies bolstering the organizations 2011-founded Firefly program.
Theyll use the opioid-abatement money to expand services to rural areas. Patients travel to VUMC representing 26 different counties says Jessica Young medical director for Firefly. The organizations goal is to get pregnant mothers into treatment so Firefly can minimize the effect on the fetus provide specialized anesthesia during birth and continue to support patients postpartum.
The opioid-abatement money will also be used to employ more peer recovery specialists with the hope of growing the profession Young says.
We have found adding peer recovery specialists to our team has really increased engagement Young says. We have fewer people who are disengaged from care. For people who do relapse I think it makes it easier for them to re-engage.
3 Nashvilles Co-Response Programs Round Out REACH pilot program releases Q3 results Partners in Care to expand to all police precincts
Mental Health Coop 2.3 million
Mental Health Coop with 12 locations statewide currently has a small grant that allows them to serve a handful of uninsured individuals per month. With the additional funding the organization will be able to serve more of them in medication-assisted treatment outpatient treatment and detox offerings. Detox offerings are difficult to find in the region and are a barrier to other forms of treatment.
To make sure people are prepared to have outpatient treatment means sometimes they need to go through detox first says chief operating officer Andrea Westerfield. Not many of those services exist across the state and our goal would be to use our 247 crisis services here in Davidson County to be able to also complete detox on site and have a safe place to do that.
Meharry Medical College 2.6 million
Dr. Lyle Cooper director of the Meharry Addiction Clinic finds that very few people with substance use disorder actually come into the clinic. Because of this much of the organizations opioid-abatement money will go toward establishing a mobile clinic in Memphis to mirror the one in Nashville.
HOPE Clinic Helping Our People Effectively started as a mobile syringe exchange program and thanks to the funding will now include fentanyl test strips xylazine test strips naloxone wound treatment HIV and hepatitis-C testing and treatment plus prescriptions for medication-assisted treatment.
Though the smallest subset of the cash just over 429000 is going to research called Tennessee Harm Reduction Efforts for Advanced Data THREAD its the part Cooper is possibly most excited about. THREAD will include a point-in-time survey and create an advisory board to allow people with substance use disorder to participate in research studies.
We know how many people go to treatment every year Cooper says. We have some idea of what the outcomes are in treatment and how many people overdose and we know some things about those folks  whether its fatal or its nonfatal. The space where we just dont know much of anything is people who are actively using drugs.
Belmont University 2.9 million
Belmont University is entering the opioid landscape for the first time with a harm-reduction program called BU Trains. The program is twofold offering training for students and current physicians as well as a mobile unit that will provide care similar to Meharrys model along existing routes for the citys outreach workers.
With Belmonts medical college set to welcome students this fall the timing is ripe. BU Trains will also serve as a teaching opportunity for the students.
We dont want to reinvent the wheel thats for sure says Tracy Frame an associate professor of pharmacy and medicine at Belmonts future medical college. We want to partner with organizations and really help everyone flourish.
Were growing says pharmacology professor Amy Henneman. Theres a sense of Where can we be helpful to Nashville We want to be an integral part of the community.
Metro Nashville Public Health Department 2.1 million
Metro Nashville Public Health Department will use the money to expand its opioid pilot program for which it is set to announce the awardee in May once approved by the Metro Council.
The program will implement an opioid care process that employs a care coordinator to guide the person through treatment including housing and transportation resources where needed. Referrals will come from the citys REACH program the emergency room and incarceration reentry as well as self-referrals from the departments clinics.
Two men have been indicted in separate fentanyl-related deaths in Nashville police announced.
Victor Scruggs 35 was indicted on a second-degree murder charge connected with a 2021 fentanyl-related death the Metro Nashville Police Department said in a news release. Smyrna resident Almurtaza Al Zerkani 28 was also indicted on a second-degree murder charge in a separate case for a 2020 fentanyl-related death.
Scruggs indictment
Scruggs' indictment stems from the death of William Young on Feb. 5 2021 police said. Young 40 was a self-employed contractor and found dead in his Nashville home. A medical examiner ruled his cause of death as acute combined drug toxicity involving fentanyl according to MNPD.
Tedious work by Specialized Investigations Division Detective Barry Demonbreun led to evidence that Scruggs sold Young heroin and methamphetamine allegedly laced with fentanyl on the same day of Youngs death the release said.
Scruggs also faces unrelated federal and state weapons charges and remains in custody according to the release.
Al Zerkani indictment
Al Zerkani's charge stems from the death of a woman in South Nashville on Nov. 13 2020 according to the release.

Mily Bolon a 22-year-old mother was found dead in her bedroom in the home she shared with her family police said. A medical examiner ruled her cause of death as acute combined drug toxicity involving fentanyl. She had a 4-year-old son the release said.
An investigation by Detective Chris McIsaac led police to Al Zerkani who they say sold pills to Bolon that looked like oxycodone. Instead those pills had fentanyl in them and were not made by a legitimate pharmaceutical company MNPD said.
Al Zerkis was jailed in lieu of a 100000 bond police said.
Police warn of dangers of fentanyl
Fentanyl is responsible for an increasing number of overdose deaths the release said. It is often found in combination with street drugs like methamphetamine heroin cocaine and marijuana.
A tiny amount of fentanyl can kill the release said.
MNPD said it has a Specialized Investigations Division that works to identify the sellers of fentanyl-laced substances behind overdose cases. Assistant District Attorney Mindy Vinecore also works to prosecute those sellers.
MNPD urges those seeking treatment for drug addiction to contact the Community Overdose Response Center which offers a free and confidential way to find drug and alcohol treatment for those at risk of overdosing. The team will work with people to find the necessary level of care.

NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  Substance abuse and mental health issues are becoming increasingly prevalent across the United States.
According to the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services TDMHSAS this is also an issue in the state of Tennessee with the annual number of fatal drug overdoses in Davidson County steadily increasing over the last seven years.
In response to these challenges TDMHSAS has established a Faith-Based Initiative to certify congregations and bring mental health and substance abuse resources to their communities.
This program is particularly important for communities of color where discussing these topics can be difficult due to the stigma surrounding mental health and addiction.
For Pastor Cornelius Hill of Ephesians Primitive Baptist Church the need for these resources became all too real when his choir director took her own life.
He recognized that his church community needed to do better in supporting members facing mental health and substance abuse issues. It's why he signed his congregation to be apart of the initiative.
The TDMHSAS Faith-Based Initiative has been certifying congregations since 2014 and recently celebrated its 1000th recovery congregation.
To become certified faith leaders must attend free training to learn more about the mental health and addiction challenges faced by their communities. The training covers a range of topics including the brain science of addiction an introduction to common mental health conditions and suicide prevention.
In addition to certifying congregations the TDMHSAS Faith-Based Community Coordinators have held about 1800 free educational events to provide education and break down the stigma of addiction. These resources are critical in helping churches bring valuable resources to their congregations and their communities.
For Pastor Hill the program is not just about providing resources but also about removing the stigma surrounding mental health and addiction. We're removing the stigma. Removing the shame. Restoring the soul. People can come to church not knowing how but knowing there is help he said.
As the TDMHSAS Faith-Based Initiative continues to expand its reach more churches are becoming involved in providing support to those struggling with mental health and substance abuse issues.

Overdose deaths among African-Americans in Tennessee have roughly doubled since 2012. Fatalities from opioids are still growing among whites in the state but deaths among blacks are surging twice as fast.
Figures from the states health department show blacks accounted for just 15 percent of all overdose deaths in the most recent year data is available. But that masks that the number of blacks dying from opioids is rising fast. In 2012 black deaths were just eight percent of overdose fatalities in Tennessee.
Lloyda Williamson chairs the psychiatry department at Meharry Medical College which specializes in minority communities. Shes only recently secured her license to prescribe medication-assisted treatment to opioid abusers. Shes concerned that opioid addiction might have been disregarded as a white problem.
Part of the difficulty is the lack of knowledge of people understanding how quickly one can become addicted and how quickly one can move from appropriate prescriptions to inappropriate use and over use and abuse she says.
Theres no clear-cut explanation for why opioids are moving more into black communities but Williamson says its obvious why they started among whites.
When you look at the history of how this crisis has gone what it really indicates is that for a number of years white individuals were more frequently prescribed opiate painkillers when you compared that to black or African-American patients she says. What it appears has happened is African-Americans are now having more access to those pain medications.
However new opioid abusers are getting in at a time when the drug is even more dangerous with many counterfeit pills laced with high-powered fentanyl. In Boston experts on the street fear African-Americans may be even more likely to end up with tainted drugs.
According to figures kept by the Centers for Disease Control Tennessee is among five states and Washington D.C. where overdose deaths for African Americans doubled in just a two year period.
Tennessee will receive more than 25 million in federal funding to combat the opioid crisis which has killed more than 5000 people in the state according to a Trump administration announcement earlier this week.
About 18.5 million will be given to the state government by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to fund opioid addiction prevention treatment and recovery programs. The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention will provide another 6.7 million to the state health department to help collect overdose data in real time and support the effort to prevent more deaths.
The Tennessee funding is part of nearly 1.8 billion in opioid crisis grants be dolled out nationwide. President Trump announced the funding on Wednesday while vaguely criticizing past administrations for not doing enough to combat addiction.
We want a safe and healthy future for every American family. Thats what I said wed do and thats what we are in the process of doing Trump said during a press conference.
He added later My administration is determined to use every resource at our disposal to smash the grip of addiction.
The opioid epidemic has hit hard in Tennessee and while the crisis is slowing in other states it is still growing here. About 5500 people died from opioid-related overdoses in the state between 2013 and 2017 according to state overdose records. CDC data shows that another 1800 died of drug overdoses in Tennessee in 2018 but it is not yet known how many of those overdoses were linked to opioids. Many nearby states saw dramatic drops in overdoses deaths in 2018 but Tennessee did not.
State epidemiologist Dr. Tim Jones said last month that Tennessee has made significant progress cutting down on prescription opioid abuse but these gains had been outweighed by the rise of fentanyl.
We were once close to the top of the pile in terms of prescription opioid use abuse and therefore deaths Jones said. Unfortunately as weve decreased opioid prescriptions there are still people who are really dependent and it can drive to heroin fentanyl and other drugs.

An 11-month-old baby girl is expected to make a full recovery after overdosing on fentanyl. Metro Police have arrested the infant's father who faces child endangerment and drug charges.
Police say 27-year-old Aras Babiry reported his daughter took a piece of paper from a bathroom trash can and put it in her mouth. She had white residue on her lips and was having difficulty breathing according to Metro Police. The child later tested positive for fentanyl and cocaine.
At a local children's hospital Babiry denied responsibility for the fentanyl. Police say he later admitted to purchasing the narcotics on Thursday and discarded the remainder in the trash can. When police searched his home officers found a straw on the living room table and a lottery ticket containing a white powdery substance.

The Metro Public Health Department in Nashville announced its participation in a new text notification program to alert the public of spikes in overdose activity. MPHD will be the only jurisdiction in Tennessee participating in this new project with Partnership to End Addiction. Public health officials hope to reach those who are at risk of suffering an overdose and their families quickly by text notifications.
Alarming levels of drug overdoses are being reported in Nashville and Middle Tennessee. More people have died in the first four months of 2021 due to drug overdose than in the first four months of 2020 and drug overdoses have steadily risen over the past five years according to MPHD.
Those interested in receiving text updates should text SPIKE to 1-855-963-5669. If you are interested in receiving more information you can send an email to Opioid.ResponseNashville.gov
MPHD continuously monitors data about drug use and outcomes across different communities in Middle Tennessee and uses several data sources to detect increases in overdoses occurring in the community.
Josh Love an epidemiologist for MPHD said the department studies changes in the number of fatal and nonfatal overdoses ages and locations and the types of drugs used. Spikes are classified as a number higher than the daily average. The summer is a peak season for overdose spiking but prediction is hard which is why the text program will help get information to the public as it becomes available.
MPHD also recommends family and friends of those at risk of a drug overdose recognize common signs such as unresponsiveness light blue or grey coloring on lips and fingertips shallow breaths and gurgling or snoring sounds.
When encountering a person who may have overdosed call 911 and stay with the person until help arrives.
The MPHD website has information about proper drug disposal drug lock boxes a syringe services program and more.
If you or someone you know is struggling with addiction call or text the Tennessee REDLINE at 1-800-889-9789 for substance abuse treatment referrals.
Given the Republican Party is so full of conspiracists and crackpots these days its understandable Tennessees federally elected GOP characters get short shrift from the media.
Competition is tough from U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia who doesnt know the difference between the Nazi Germany police force and cold tomato soup. A year ago U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas left his constituents to freeze when a 2021 ice storm took down the states power grid heading to Mexico to escape the chill at a luxury resort before being shamed home.
Kentucky U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie revealed in 2019 he didnt understand that political science is a liberal arts course during a clash with former Secretary of State John Kerry. Massie has since made more news after starting a holiday trend posing with his entire family holding weapons for his 2020 Christmas card.
I could go on for I havent even begun to write about the federal lawmakers propping up the Trump-led Jan. 6 insurrection and continued effort to overturn the 2020 election cc U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri but I write to call attention to Tennessees GOP ranks.
We havent written about senior U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn in a good while but her actions of late beg to be addressed.
To paraphrase a reporter from another outlet she doesnt get the media coverage that some of the other GOP standouts get but she says things that are way out there.
Over the last two weeks Blackburn held up congressional negotiations over a federal funding package a move that almost led to a government shutdown over an initiative by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration within the Health and Human Services Department to provide funds for organizations that distribute harm reduction kits to drug users.
The kits are aimed at reducing the spread of disease among users and include items like test strips for fentanyla synthetic opioid responsible for rising overdose cases both nationally and in Tennesseelock boxes for medication safe sex kits Federal Drug Administration-approved overdose reversal medication and syringes.
Blackburn or her staff members could have done a bit of research I googled harm reduction strategies in Europe to find out how similar strategies combined with decriminalization of small amounts of illicit drugs and a focus on the treatment of substance abuse has radically reduced overdoses in Portugal. When the U.S. had about 72000 drug overdose deaths in 2019 Portugal had less than 100.
Blackburn or a member of her staff could have researched harm reduction strategies but she chose to hold up the federal budget over false claims crack pipes would be distributed to substance abusers ignoring her own role in Americas opioid crisis.
But no. Instead Blackburn read conservative outlets like the Washington Free Beacon which published a story on Feb. 7 saying the Biden administration planned on buying crack pipes. Despite the story being debunked it remains at the top of the site.
The same day Blackburn posted a video tweet saying the Biden administration is busy filling vending machines with crack pipes.
What non-Tennessee outlets missed however is the rich irony of Blackburn complaining about funds used to help alleviate the opioid epidemic.
Since Blackburn first ran for Congress in 2002 she has taken more than 1 million in contributions from pharmaceutical companies or health PACs many associated with the same companies making opioid painkillers or distributing them across rural America.
As a congresswoman in 2014 she co-sponsored the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act. Thats a nice name for a bill that was written by a pharmaceutical industry lobbyist and one that significantly hinders the governments ability to halt suspicious shipments of narcotics.
A 2017 investigation by CBS News and the Washington Post into how the bill became law named Blackburn as a key backer of the legislation. Later she said the law may have had unintended consequences but an official with the Drug Enforcement Agency said he had briefed her in 2016 on how the law would worsen the opioid crisis.
Such hypocrisy coming from Blackburn holding up government funding over her moral outrage that Americans with substance abuse issues might get help while ignoring her own role in the continued opioid crisis.Tennesseans continue to die at alarming rates from opioid overdoses. According to reports from the Tennessee Department of Health 1451 Tennesseans died of overdoses in 2015 prior to the Blackburn-sponsored bill becoming law.
By 2020 the number had doubled with 3020 Tennesseans dying of drug overdoses. Overdoses from fentanyl increased by 50 according to health department statistics.
Given Blackburns willingness to play partisan politics chase red herrings and deny help to those in desperate need some days even Ted Cruz looks good.
When two people died recently from drug overdoses about a mile from each other along the Murfreesboro Road corridor their test results showed the presence of xylazine a sedative used for horses and cattle.
On a hunch Metro Nashville police Sgt. Mike Hotz signed into the evidence room pulled out 120000 counterfeit pills seized last month and tested them.
They tested positive for acetaminophen  a common binder material  fentanyl and xylazine.
He tested another set of seized pills. They too tested positive for the veterinary drug.
That is a significant quantity of pills that was destined for the streets of Nashville Hotz said during a Metro Nashville Public Health and Safety Committee meeting Tuesday. I believe that it's important for the public as well as our public officials to understand that unfortunately in my opinion xylazine is here on scene in Nashville's drug supply.
Hotz tracks and monitors all fatal drug overdoses in the city and what he and his fellow officers are seeing is startling he said Tuesday. Almost every time the drug was working in concert with fentanyl Hotz said.
The Metro Public Health Department tracks data on all suspected drug overdoses in the city issuing quarterly reports of their findings.
The department first included xylazine in their 2021 fourth quarter report where it was found in 2.7 of overdose deaths about 20 cases more than doubling the number from 2020.
In 2022 the cases doubled again to 40 fatal overdoses involving xylazine and cases have remained steady according to the 2023 fourth quarter report.
MoreAhead of a Tennessee opioid trial lawyers squabble over a monkey named Carlos
But even with steady numbers Hotz raised serious concerns. In Pennsylvania and other places where the drug first emerged officials were not equipped to handle it which led to skyrocketing mortality rates Hotz said.
Xylazine can cause severe breathing issues blood clots damage to muscles nerves and kidneys as well as serious open wounds that have at times led to amputation of limbs Hotz said.
Council member Jordan Huffman who represents parts of Donelson and Hermitage noted during the meeting the impact the drug is having in his district.
I recently had a homeless camp closed in my district and I have seen what xylazine does to the human body firsthand he said during the Tuesday meeting. Going in these camps and seeing the decay and loss of limbs is extremely traumatic not only for those that see it but my goodness the people that have to deal with it.
It also can cause people to develop a dual addiction with fentanyl with which is it commonly paired. Narcan has no impact on reversing the side effects of xylazine.
Huffman asked if there is a treatment for the drug.
There is nothing approved for human use that reverses a xylazine overdose Hotz said. That will need professional medical intervention usually to include significant breathing treatments.

I had never seen death the way I've seen death when it comes to opioid addiction says Thomas Gooch a recovery counselor in Nashville Tenn. On his phone Gooch displays a picture of his wife who died of an overdose.
In one way or another Thomas Gooch has spent more than 30 years struggling with illegal drugs. The 52-year-old Nashville Tenn. native grew up in extreme poverty. He was first incarcerated in 1988 and spent the next 15 years in and out of jail for using and selling narcotics. Until 2003 Gooch says. That was the first time I went to treatment and the last time I used. Since then for most of 19 years Gooch has been trying to get others into recovery or just keep them alive. He handed out clean needles and injection-drug equipmentwhich reduce injuries infections and overdose deathsin Nashvilles hardest-hit communities. In 2014 he founded My Fathers House a transitional recovery facility for fathers struggling with substance use disorder.
But despite Goochs long experience the opioid epidemic recently has brought a level of devastation to the Black community that has shocked him. I had never seen death the way Ive seen death when it comes to opioid addiction he says. Theres been so many funerals it doesnt even make sense. I personally know at least 50 to 60 individuals who died from overdoses in the last 10 years. That staggering body count includes Goochs recently estranged wife in 2020 and a former partner in 2019.
A million people in the U.S. have died of opioid overdoses since the 1990s. But the faceand raceof the opioid epidemic has changed in the past decade. Originally white and middle class victims are now Black and brown people struggling with long-term addictions and too few resources. During 10 brutal years opioid and stimulant deaths have increased 575 percent among Black Americans. In 2019 the overall drug overdose death rate among Black people exceeded that of whites for the first time 36.8 versus 31.6 per 100000. And with the addition of fentanyl the synthetic opioid thats 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine Black men older than 55 who survived for decades with a heroin addiction are dying at rates four times greater than people of other races in that age group.

The reasons for this dramatic change come down to racial inequities. Research shows that Black people have a harder time getting into treatment programs than white people do and Black people are less likely to be prescribed the gold standard medications for substance use therapy. If you are a Black person and have an opioid use disorder you are likely to receive treatment five years later than if youre a white person says Nora D. Volkow director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health. Treatments are extraordinarily useful in terms of preventing overdose death so you can actually recover. Five years can make the difference between being alive or not. Black people with substance use problems are afraid of being caught up in a punitive criminal justice system and are less likely to have insurance good enough to allow them to seek help on their own. And the COVID pandemic disrupted many recovery and harm-reduction services particularly for people of color.
Gooch blames straight-out racial discrimination in the health-care system too. When we call different places to try to get people into treatment the question they ask is What drug do they use he recounts with exasperation. If you say crack all of a sudden they aint got no bed available. If you say opioids and heroin they will find a bed because thats the demographic they want. A couple of times I told patients that the only way theyre going to get help is to get drunk and turn themselves into Vanderbilt Hospital because Vanderbilt will hold them for five days and thatll get them into treatment.
Gooch is one of the people trying to improve access to therapies for addiction and change the overall dysfunctional dynamic. Other groups are bringing more effective addiction treatments within prison walls reducing the chances of recidivism on release. A proposed federal law would make therapy with the commonly used addiction medication methadone less onerous for an impoverished population as well as less stigmatizing. And Volkow is using her platform at the NIH to highlight the overwhelming research-based evidence for better ways to understand and treat addiction.
Access to Treatment
The nations historic reluctance to treat addiction as a health-care issue rather than a criminal justice one has resulted in a health-care system where too few people of any racejust 10 percentreceive treatment for substance use disorder. Several factors such as stigma and an inability to afford or access care make the numbers considerably more dismal among people of color. Even after a nonfatal overdose Black patients are half as likely to be referred to or access treatment as non-Hispanic white patients according to federal government data.
A growing recognition that criminalization and incarceration do little to curb illegal drug use or improve public health or safety has led to harm-reduction policies such as Good Samaritan lawsstatutes that provide limited immunity for low-level drug violations and increase availability of naloxone a drug that can reverse overdose. But racial disparities have emerged in the application and effectiveness of both measures. A study from RTI International found that Black and Latino intravenous drug users have inequitable access to the medication.
Loftin Wilson program manager for the NC Harm Reduction Coalition in Durham N.C. who has worked in the field for more than a decade says the problems with inequality lead to distrust in the system which creates a vicious cycle in which people who need help wont go to institutions that can provide help. People entering treatment worry with good reason that dealing with the social service system can cause them to lose their employment housing or even custody of their children. Thats another example of the negative experiences people who use drugs have. They definitely dont land equally on everybody and people dont experience them all the same way. It is a vastly different experience to be a Black drug user seeking health care than for a white person Wilson says.
University of Cincinnati psychologist Kathleen Burlew notes as Volkow does that when Black patients enter treatment they are more likely to do so later than white people and are less likely to complete it. In addition to mistrust she says the less favorable outcomes result from factors such as clinician bias and lack of racial and ethnic diversity among treatment providers.
Federal resources such as grants to support local opioid use disorder clinics and programs also tend to favor white populations. According to 2021 data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 77 percent of the clients treated with grant funding were white 12.9 percent were Black and 2.8 percent were Native American. The disparity is even more pronounced in some states. For example in 2019 North Carolina announced that white people made up 88 percent of those served by its 54-million federal grant compared with 7.5 percent for Black people. Native Americans accounted for less than 1 percent of those served.
Medication Inequality
Research has shown that there is a bias among health-care providers against using medication-assisted treatment MAT which combines FDA-approved drugs with counseling and behavioral therapies. Substance use specialists consider it the best approach to the opioid use problem. Yet a study published in JAMA Network found that about 40 percent of the 368 U.S. residential drug programs surveyed did not offer MAT and 21 percent actively discouraged people from using it. Many addiction treatment programs are faith-based and see addiction as a moral problem which leads to the conclusion that relying on medication for abstinence or sobriety simply trades one form of addiction for another. Many general practitioners who lack training in addiction medicine have this misconception.
The three medications approved by the FDA are buprenorphine methadone and naltrexone. Buprenorphine and methadone are synthetic opioids that block brain opioid receptors and reduce both cravings and withdrawal. Naltrexone is a postdetox monthly injectable that blocks the effects of opioids. Very few insurance providers in the U.S. cover all three medications and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the full range of medications is far less available to Black people.
Research suggests that economics and race influence who receives which medications. Buprenorphine for instance is more widely available in counties with predominantly white communities whereas methadone clinics are usually located in poor communities of color.
To use methadone patients must make daily visits to a clinic to receive and take the medication under the supervision of a practitioner. This requirement makes it difficult to do things that build a normal life such as attending school and obtaining and maintaining a job. There is also the stigma of standing in a public line known to everyone passing by as a queue for addiction treatment. The treatment model was developed during the Nixon administration based on racism and a stigmatized view of people with addiction without any thought of privacy or dignity or treating addiction like a health problem says Andrew Kolodny medical director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative at Brandeis University. The stigma is made worse by methadones classification as a Schedule II controlled substance which is defined as a substance with a high potential for abuse potentially leading to severe psychological or physical dependence. This categorization pushed the medication into a quasicriminalized status and the clinics into minority communities.
Buprenorphine however is a completely different story. When opioid use problems increased in white communities Congress acted to create less stigmatizing treatment options. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 DATA 2000 lifted an 86-year ban that prevented treating opioid addiction with narcotic medications such as buprenorphine which today is sold under the brand names Subutex and Suboxone. The majority of doctors who got special federal licenses to prescribe it accept only commercial health insurance and cash so the drug is usually offered to a more affluent population which in the U.S. means white people. About 95 percent of buprenorphine patients are white and 34 percent have private insurance according to a national study of data through 2015.
John Woodyear is an addiction treatment specialist in Troy a small rural town in south central North Carolina where the epidemic is exacting an increasingly heavy toll on the Black and Native American populations. Overall overdose death rates increased 40 percent from 2019 to 2020 but death rates among those two groups in particular went up 66 and 93 percent respectively. Yet Woodyear who is Black and practices in a town that is 31 percent Black says his patients are 90 percent white. People come to the clinic through word of mouth or referrals from friends. As long as Woodyears patients are mostly white new patients will be mostly white as well he says.
One exception to this racial pattern is Edwin Chapmans clinic in the Northeast neighborhood of Washington D.C. one of the districts predominantly Black and most impoverished communities. Chapman a physician often prescribes buprenorphine to his patients with opioid use problems and the overwhelming majority of them are Black. He says that to prescribe the drug physicians like him must get past certain roadblocks. The insurance companies in many states put more restrictions on patients in an urban setting such as requiring prior authorization for addiction treatment he says. Further to increase the dose above 16 or 24 milligrams you may have to get a prior authorization. The dosing standards were based on the white population and people who were addicted to pills. Our surviving Black population often needs a higher dose of buprenorphine.
Chapman says few physicians in private practice are willing to treat these patients. They dont really feel comfortable having these patients in their office or they arent really prepared to deal with the economic and mental health issues that come with this population he explains those disorders include bipolar disorder and schizophrenia among others.
People have their own biases that keep them away from medication such as buprenorphine Wilson says. Many view it as simply trading one drug for another. They think If Im going to take this step why not just go to detox and not take any medications at all he says. Theres a big cultural misunderstanding about the fact that these medications are the only evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder. Short-term detox isnt the most appropriate intervention for most people.
Gooch agrees that the bias is real. He facilitates recovery groups at a program operated by a group from Meharry Medical College a historically Black institution. Yet I havent seen one Black person yet Gooch says. Some think its a setup. Theres so much distrust they have a hard time thinking its legal. Its just the culture of Black people. Many are religious and think taking the drug is wrong.
Those misconceptions are holdovers from our having been miseducated from the outset Chapman says. Whites have done a tremendous job educating their community that this is a medical problem a disease. In the African American community drug addiction has always been and continues to be seen as a moral problem and incarceration was the treatment.
Hope for Change
In the November 2021 issue of Neuropsychopharmacology Volkow argued that it is long past time for a new approach to drug addiction that would address these misconceptions within the most affected populations and biases among providers. We have known for decades that addiction is a medical conditiona treatable brain disordernot a character flaw or a form of social deviance she wrote.
Volkow argues that treatment reform should start with prison and the criminal justice system. Even though there is no difference along racial lines in who uses illegal drugs Black people nonetheless were arrested for drug offenses at five times the rate of white people in 2016. The racial disproportionality in incarcerated drug offenders does not reflect higher rates of drug law violations only higher rates of arrest among racial and ethnic minorities. Currently the number of arrests for heroin which more Black people use exceeds the arrests for diverted prescription opioids which more white people use even though the latter is more prevalent.
These unequal arrests and incarcerations add to the racial inequalities in drug treatment and survival rates. An estimated two thirds of people in U.S. correctional settings have a diagnosable substance use disorder and approximately 95 percent will relapse after their release. In the two weeks postrelease the risk of overdose increases more than 100-fold and the chances of death increase 12-fold.
Paradoxically that makes prisons and jailsinstitutions with the most obvious and overt racial disparitiesthe places with the greatest potential to bring about effective change. Volkow points to a recent NIH study as proof that starting substance disorder treatment during incarceration lowers the risk of probation violations and reincarcerations and improves the chances of recovery. But only one in 13 prisoners with substance use problems receives treatment according to a Pew data analysis.
Some local programs have started to tackle some of these issues. In Pittsburgh the Allegheny Health Networks RIvER Rethinking Incarceration and Empowering Recovery Clinic opened in May 2021. Its goal is to reduce recidivism among people with addictions by providing care for the formerly incarcerated immediately on their release from jail regardless of their ability to pay. Since opening the clinics caregivers have engaged with hundreds of people.
New York City recently became the first municipality in the country to sanction overdose prevention centers where people with substance use disorder can use drugs under medical supervision. Two sites one in East Harlem and the other in Washington Heights opened in December 2021. They have had more than 10000 visits and prevented nearly 200 overdoses by administering the medication naloxone.
There are other signs of change too. California signed a law that requires every treatment provider in the state to provide a client bill of rights to notify patients of all aspects of recommended treatment including no treatment at all treatment risks and expected results. And federal authorities loosened methadone regulations during the pandemic. Instead of daily in-person visits more patients were allowed to use telehealth consultations and take doses home. Senators Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Rand Paul of Kentucky have introduced a bill that would make that change permanent. Among other programs and initiatives across the country these are an indication that drug treatment policy may be headed in a more equitable evidence-based direction.

Now to the opioid crisis in the United States.
President Trump addressed the issue today with a team of advisers meeting in New Jersey. It's a problem touching all corners of the country.
As the mayor of Nashville Tennessee Megan Barry has dealt with an increase in the number of overdose deaths in her city.
But last month it took a very personal turn.
Lisa Desjardins has more.
NASHVILLE Tenn.  The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services TDMHSAS is receiving more than 53 million in additional funding from the federal government to address post-COVID mental health and substance use needs.
The supplemental block grant funding will add more than 27 million to mental health services and nearly 26 million to substance use services over the next four years. The funding is part of a 3 billion allocation included in the American Rescue Plan signed into law in March.
The new funding comes on top of significant supplemental funding from the federal government and new investment of state dollars. TDMHSAS has received an additional 55 million in COVID relief funding from the federal government since the start of the pandemic and Governor Bill Lee and the Tennessee General Assembly increased the departments budget for next fiscal year by more than 44.1 million.
The most recent rounds of federal funding supplement the states existing Mental Health Block Grant and Substance Abuse Block Grants. New dollars will expand the availability of evidence-based treatment services strengthen the statewide network of crisis services support the continued and expanded use of telehealth services respond to the unique needs of children and more. TDMHSAS and federal partners are both allowing room for mental health and substance use treatment agencies across the state to design programs that meet their communities unique needs.
With the outpouring of support for mental health and substance use needs in our state we have a priceless opportunity to bring about significant change and make a difference for Tennesseans who are struggling. The mental health and substance use impacts brought on by the stresses of the pandemic are with us and these generous investments at both the state and federal levels are going to make sure we and our community behavioral health providers can continue to rise to meet the need said TDMHSAS Commissioner Marie Williams LCSW. We are tremendously grateful to our amazing network of providers across the state who answer the call and respond with compassionate care to help people find new lives in recovery.
During the pandemic the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveyed people in Tennessee and across the nation on feelings of anxiety and depression. Tennesseans self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression at rates of more than 40 which is more than double the normal prevalence of any mental illness in a given year.
Tennessee also saw a tragic spike in drug overdoses in the first few months of the pandemic. Thanks to the work of the Regional Overdose Prevention Specialists and other harm reduction groups the rate of drug overdose returned to normal levels but still too many Tennesseans are dying from a preventable cause.

TobyMac's son is one of hundreds of people to die in 2019 across greater Nashville as a result of an overdose involving fentanyl  an epidemic health experts on Wednesday said they expect to worsen this year.
Truett Foster McKeehan the Christian rap artist's 21-year-old son is one of 424 people who died of drug overdoses in Davidson County with 64 of those deaths involving fentanyl Metro Public Health Department records show.
Provisional data for 2019 shows a 28 increase from 2018 said Trevor Henderson Nashvilles opioid response coordinator. Last year's numbers are provisional he noted and may increase as cases are closed.
Moreover projections for fatal drug overdoses for 2020 show the trend will likely continue to worsen with fentanyl remaining the primary contributor health officials said.
McKeehan was found unresponsive at a home in the city's Radnor neighborhood on Oct. 23. Autopsy and toxicology results show he died with a cocktail of drugs in his system.
Davidson County Medical Examiner Feng Li ruled McKeehan's cause of death to be acute combined drug intoxication stemming from an accidental overdose of fentanyl and amphetamines.
Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that can be fatal in doses no larger than a few grains of sand said Dr. David Edwards chief of the division of pain medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
In powder form Edwards said. It's just a little bit of dust in a small vial but enough micrograms can kill you.
Its cheaper to produce than heroin but approximately 50 times stronger so some drug traffickers mix fentanyl into their drug supply to inflate profits. Fentanyl is also increasingly found combined with cocaine and methamphetamine both of which have caused more deaths in recent years.
McKeehan's toxicology findings show he had 8.7 nanograms per milliliter of blood of fentanyl in his system and 7.9 nanograms per milliliter of blood of metabolized fentanyl in his system.
In deaths related to fentanyl Edwards said blood concentrations can vary widely but in a New York state review of autopsies representing people who died with multiple drugs in their system an average of 8.2 nanograms per milliliters of blood with a range of 1.1 up to 38 led to their deaths.
Drug use in Middle TennesseeA spike in overdose deaths in Nashville may be tied to fentanyl health officials warn
In Li's summary report he wrote McKeehan had a history of drug and alcohol abuse as well as possible nitrous oxide use. Nitrous oxide is commonly known as laughing gas. He was discovered unresponsive in bed by a friend conducting a welfare check on Oct. 23.
A toxicology report also found McKeehan had adderall and marijuana among other drugs in his system at the time of death.
It was not immediately known where McKeehan got the drugs.
Metro police spokeswoman Kris Mumford said the case remained open on Wednesday.
Other Middle TN cases
More than 9100 people died of drug overdoses in Tennessee between 2013 and 2018 according to state death data. More than 70 of those deaths were at least partially caused by opioids including fentanyl.
A 26-year-old Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival attendee died in 2019 after he overdosed on drugs including fentanyl.
Ryan Dunleavy of Brentwood was found the morning of June 15 in the venue's Manchester's campgrounds his autopsy results show. He was transported to Unity Medical Center in Manchester where he was pronounced dead.
According to a toxicology report Dunleavy had drugs including fentanyl MDMA ecstasy and clozapine in his system when he died. Autopsy results show Dunleavy's manner of death was accidental.
In some of the overdose cases across Tennessee authorities have arrested the decedent's dealer. It's part of a strategy to fight the opioid epidemic.
One month before Dunleavy overdosed  after nearly a year and a half of extensive investigative work  Metro Nashville police charged 32-year-old Christopher James Floyd with murder in connection to a woman's 2017 death.
Authorities said Roberts provided the mix of heroin and fentanyl that killed Sara Roberts who fatally overdosed at the East Thompson Lane home where she lived with her mother.
An autopsy found the 33-year-old Nashville woman died of acute drug toxicity from a combination of alcohol and heroin laced with fentanyl.
Floyd remained jailed in Davidson County Wednesday awaiting trial on more than 100000 bond.

In just two years fentanyl poisoning deaths have doubled across the nation and in 30 states including Tennessee deaths have more than doubled according to a new analysis from Families Against Fentanyl.
The Volunteer state is among 20 states with the highest number of fentanyl deaths last year according to the nonprofit's analysis calculated using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from May 2019-2021.
More'No parent should go through this' Fentanyl drives explosion of drug overdoses in South
In six states  Alaska Colorado Louisiana Mississippi California and Texas  fentanyl fatalities increased nearly fivefold according to the study.
Meanwhile the fentanyl nightmare is driving an explosion of drug overdoses in the South.
Overdose deaths reported each year have risen more than 70 during the past five years in Alabama Arkansas Louisiana Mississippi and Tennessee according to CDC data analyzed by The Tennessean.
Those five states combined reported nearly 4100 overdose deaths in 2016. By 2020  the most recent year on record  the same states reported nearly 7000 overdose deaths.
In some states a life-saving drug is just a few clicks away.
The anti-overdose medication naloxone also known by the brand name Narcan is for sale at NaloxoneExchange.com which is run by a fast-growing startup that expanded into Tennessee in 2019.
Naloxone is largely viewed as a front-line defense to the opioid crisis because it can be injected or inhaled to reverse an opioid overdose in the moment.
Loved ones who lost someone to fentanyl poisoning have started nonprofits  not only to get the word out about access to Narcan but to spread word about the epidemic and even offer fentanyl paper test strips which are an easy and inexpensive method to avert a drug overdose. They can detect the presence of fentanyl in pills powder or injectables.
In some cases nonprofits are even offering to help compensate families with funeral costs.
Nonprofit efforts across the South
Wanting to keep her son's legacy alive Tonja Jacobs created the Romello A. Marchman Foundation a nonprofit to help families in Nashville who are grieving after losing a loved one from an accidental fentanyl overdose.
The Antioch-based organization founded in 2021 works to help families of young people between 15 and 25 years old who died of an accidental fentanyl overdose with funeral expenses in Davidson County.
It gives 500 to each family to help pay for services.
Jacobs is pushing lawmakers to put up billboards across Nashville that read One pill can kill.
I feel very strongly that the Tennessee government is responsible for their residents and they need to get this information out there she said.
In Arkansas the Matt Adams Foundation offers financial assistance for treatment and transitional programs while working to break down the stigma of addiction and encourage hope healing and second chances.
The nonprofit also distributes naloxone and fentanyl test strips.
We provide a safe space no questions asked said Heather Starbuck who founded the nonprofit. We focus on harm reduction. We also push to get naloxone out to first responders who dont have it.

WASHINGTON  Lawmakers should view Americas staggering opioid crisis including the rise of illicit fentanyl through an ecosystems approach argues a massive RAND Corporation report published Thursday.
That means they should examine the gaps and interconnections among emergency response data collection education treatment housing and law enforcement the report advises.
The 600-page volume  which the authors describe as arguably the most comprehensive analysis of opioids in 21st century America  encourages federal state and local lawmakers to think beyond traditional silos and innovate ways to stem adverse effects of addiction and increasing drug overdose deaths among Americans.
There have been lots of initiatives and efforts to try to address it but when we looked around the majority not all but the majority seemed to fall in the silos  like Were going to improve treatment or Were going to focus on harm reduction or Were going to decrease illicit use and try to decrease supply said Bradley Stein Director of RANDs Opioid Policies Tools and Information Center.
RAND headquartered in Santa Monica California is a nonprofit organization that focuses on several areas including the U.S. military education national security and health care.
One of the things we did was sort of step back and say Are there opportunities sort of between these systems between the silos And so thinking about it more as an ecosystem or more holistically are there things and opportunities that we may be overlooking Stein one of the authors who is based in RANDs Pittsburgh offices told States Newsroom.
Overdose rates jump in recent years
Drug overdose rates in the U.S. have risen fivefold in the past two decades according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study published in December.
The study shows that deaths attributed to opioids including synthetic opioids like fentanyl and its many analogs have been steadily on the rise with a staggering jump in recent years.
The CDC tracked a record 107622 overdose deaths in 2021  71238 of them were due to manmade illegal fentanyl substances.
The agency defines drug poisoning overdose deaths as those resulting from the unintentional or intentional overdose of a drug being given the wrong drug taking a drug in error or taking a drug inadvertently.
Illicit fentanyl ending up in other drugs  for example counterfeit prescription pills cocaine and heroin  has been the target of federal agencies and the subject of multiple congressional hearings and roundtables.
GOP lawmakers on the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee are poised to mark up the HALT Fentanyl Act a measure reintroduced this Congress by Republican Reps. Morgan Griffith of Virginia and Bob Latta of Ohio.
The bill aims to permanently classify fentanyl-related analogs as Class I substances under the Controlled Substances Act.
Just this month a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers including Democratic Reps. Joe Neguse of Colorado and Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania launched the Fentanyl Prevention Caucus.
The group plans to tackle education and destigmatizing the opioid overdose-reversing medication Naloxone said Dean who is public about her sons recovery from opioid addiction.
Not enough data
One of the gaps facing lawmakers as they try to legislate a solution is a lack of data. The U.S. is essentially flying blind the RAND report states.
Weve had this opioid crisis for a while but if we look nationally there are still all these areas where we still dont have a good sense of the magnitude of the problem. How many people use fentanyl how many people are using heroin Stein said.
Stigmatization of users unintended consequences of criminal penalties and a lack of communication across systems all hamper clear data collection that could improve peoples quality of life in other areas  for example housing child welfare and employment the report argues.
However some state and local governments are developing ways to bring data together Stein said.
The report notes that Maryland has linked data across health care substance use treatment criminal and legal statistics and mortality information.
Rhode Island has pulled several data sets including valuable information collected from nonfatal overdoses and distribution networks of Naloxone in one data center hub.
Pennsylvanias opioid data dashboard among other data tracks the number of Naloxone doses administered by EMS personnel and emergency room visits for opioid overdoses
Tim Leech vice president of Pittsburgh Firefighters Local 1 responds to varying volumes of drug overdose emergency calls that ebb and flow with the trends of local drug use.
We are usually the first ones to encounter the patient. Once were there and we start treating the patient the paramedics will arrive. And depending on the severity its possible that a doctor could come as well after the patients care is handed over to the paramedics Leech said in an interview. No matter what happens every call I go on when I go back to the fire station I submit information on our computer database and theres a code for overdoses.
Dean talked about efforts in the Philadelphia area to coordinate care across institutions.
We have an area of the city known as Kensington where some of the most difficult cases of mental health poverty and addiction are all coming together she said mentioning that she recently spoke to the Philadelphia-based Sheller Foundation about efforts to address overdoses.
So literally what the Sheller foundation is doing is trying to bring together different hospital systems and nonprofits and recovery centers and housing to get at this problem in a very coordinated way instead of just one recovery at an ER and out goes the person with the problem to another ER.
Advice to lawmakers
The RAND report several years in the making suggests a four-part framework that decision makers can use when thinking about crafting effective policies to help those with substance use disorders.
That four-pronged approach includes
Integrating issues and systems.
Experimenting with new approaches.
Developing roles for people who can take ownership across systems.
Revamping data systems to better understand the problem.
The studys authors built a searchable tool to encourage a holistic approach when policymakers are weighing how to tackle the opioid crisis.
Theres not a silver bullet Stein said.  Individuals with opioid use disorder move across so many pieces of this ecosystem. But often one part of the system doesnt have a very good idea of whats going on in another part of the system.

TriStar Health hospitals will partner with local law enforcement to host Crush the Crisis opioid take back day.
The community is invited to safely and anonymously dispose of unused or expired prescription medications at participating TriStar Health hospitals.
The opioid crisis has been declared a public health emergency. Every day more than 130 people in the United States die from opioid-related drug overdoses. The misuse of prescription opioids often begins when they are obtained from a friend or family member's medicine cabinet. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse in 2017 there were 1269 overdose deaths involving opioids in Tennesseea rate of 19.3 deaths per 100000 persons which is higher than the national rate of 14.6 deaths per 100000 persons. Kentucky is among the top ten states with the highest opioid-related overdose deaths. In 2017 there were 1160 reported opioid-involved deaths in Kentuckya rate of 27.9 deaths per 100000 persons compared to the average national rate of 14.6 deaths per 100000 persons.
Our goal for 'Crush the Crisis' is to bring awareness to the dangers of opioid addiction and increase awareness about the proper disposal of these medications said Dr. Jeffrey Hodrick orthopedic surgeon. Opioid addiction can happen to anyone and unused opioids are a major source of misuse and diversion. We want to provide this opportunity as a confidential and anonymous way for the community to dispose of their unused medication properly.

The growing concern over opioid abuse has prompted both the federal government and many states to address concerns over referrals for substance abuse treatment. Tennessee recently addressed the issue in House Bill No. 2068 which took effect July 1 2018 and significantly impacts the marketing and referral practices of providers of alcohol and drug treatment services. Additionally on October 24 2018 President Trump signed into law a new sweeping bill aimed at the opioid crisis which also targets marketing and referral practices. This alert has a targeted focus on the new Tennessee law but updates on the federal law are forthcoming.
With a few minor exceptions the law impacts anyone who provides alcohol and drug services in Tennessee including the following licensed providers 1 alcohol and drug services providers licensed under Title 33 of the Tennessee Code Annotated 2 health care providers such as physicians nurses physician assistants and psychologists licensed under Title 63 and 3 health care facilities including hospitals licensed under Title 68.
The law generally prohibits four types of conduct by alcohol and drug services providers 1 making false or misleading statements about the provider's identity products goods services or geographical locations in marketing materials 2 including any false information or electronic links coding or activation on a website that provides false information or that surreptitiously directs the reader to another website 3 soliciting or receiving or attempting to solicit or receive a commission or kickback in return for a referral to or from a provider of alcohol and drug services and 4 entering into an arrangement with a marketing provider who agrees to generate referrals through a call center or web-based presence provided that this may be acceptable if certain disclosures are made to the patient. It is unclear exactly what type of conduct regulators will target under the marketing-related prohibition but a general review of marketing materials and website content is warranted in light of the new law. Additionally this is a good time to review all relationships with referral sources to ensure such arrangements do not present risk under the new law.
Penalties for violations of the law vary depending on licensure of the offender. In general the range for civil penalties is 250 to 5000 per violation. Perhaps more importantly all violations can lead to suspension or revocation of the provider's license regardless of which Tennessee regulatory authority issued the license.
Of key importance to note the new Tennessee law and the new federal law both demonstrate the focus on cracking down on a wide variety of marketing practices. Unlike many other health care fraud and abuse laws prohibited conduct under the new Tennessee law and the new federal law is not limited to marketing or referrals involving beneficiaries of governmental programs. These laws have general application to all types of patients including private pay and those covered by private insurance. Therefore all providers of alcohol and drug treatment services need to be aware of the changing landscape in this area and review both their marketing practices and any commission or incentive programs to ensure compliance.
If you have questions on how this law will affect your operations please contact Layna Rush or any member of the Baker Ober Health Law Group.
Drug overdose deaths continued to rise throughout Tennessee last year primarily because of a dramatic spike in deaths attributed to fentanyl an exceptionally powerful opioid for which a lethal dose is no larger than two grains of sand.
In total 1776 Tennesseans died in drug overdoses in 2017 up from 1631 the prior year according to a Monday announcement from the Tennessee Department of Health. This is at least the sixth year in a row that the death toll has risen.
More Tennesseans died last year from drug overdoses than from automobile crashes said Health Commissioner John Dreyzehner in a news release announcing the overdose death toll. Few of us have escaped a direct impact of this crisis in experiencing the tragic death of a family member loved one or friend.
Prescription opioids like hydrocodone and oxycodone remain the most common cause of overdoses  associated with 644 deaths  according to the new statistics. But the death toll was boosted by a second year of skyrocketing deaths attributed to fentanyl a synthetic opioid that was largely unknown only a few years ago. Fentanyl deaths rose 74 percent in 2016 killing 294 then another 70 percent in 2017 killing 500.
The spike mirrors what has been previously reported in Nashville where city data showed fentanyl deaths surpassed heroin deaths for the first time in 2017. Experts said this represented a deepening of the opioid crisis with more addicts transitioning from prescription pills to street drugs which are sometimes laced with fentanyl.
Fentanyl is similar to heroin but cheaper to make and 50 times stronger so drug dealers mix it into their product to maximize profits. This causes overdoses because addicts believe they are using heroin but are actually injecting much more potent fentanyl.
OPIOIDSFor years it was illegal to give out clean needles in Nashville. They did it anyway.
Fentanyl has also been found laced into cocaine and in fake prescription medications which are made with black market pill presses and sold to unknowing victims on the street.
You cant know what youre getting when you buy drugs on the street and that makes them extremely dangerous said Dr. David Ragon chief medical officer for the state health department in the news release. We are alarmed by the growing number of Tennesseans dying from drug overdoses especially involving fentanyl. We must place additional focus on prevention of substance abuse.
In a statement announcing the overdose deaths TBI Director David Rausch said his agency would remain committed to disrupting the supply of fentanyl and other drugs. The new overdose statistics he said were further proof that the danger of Tennessees opioid epidemic is real immediate and continuing to grow.
Dreyzhner the state health commissioner said the new overdose deaths underscore the need for reasonable limits on prescription medication and additional treatment resources for addicts.
The good news is this has spurred us collectively to more action than ever before and while prescription drugs still account for the majority of deaths there is new hope on the horizon in many areas he said. Prevention works stigma is decreasing treatment is effective and people get better.
OPIOIDSFor years heroin has been the deadliest drug in Nashville. Not anymore.

Hayden Panettiere has been open about her struggles with addiction to alcohol and opioids since she came forward in 2022  after years of battling the disease. Her life also became fodder for tabloid headlines as she weathered through her mental health issues postpartum depression and a tumultuous relationship with her ex-fiancé Wladimir Klitschko. But there are many more layers to her story and its heartbreaking to hear.
Much of the 34-year-old actrress difficult time happened while she was starring on Nashville playing Juliette Barnes a rising superstar in the country music industry. While she loved playing the character and the opportunity it gave her in Hollywood she also described it to The Messenger as very traumatizing because I felt like I was acting out my own life. Panettiere began to notice that her personal struggles became the main storyline for her role. Related story Hayden Panettiere Is Making Moves in Her Hollywood Comeback With This Major Project
NASHVILLE Hayden Panettiere Charles Esten in Fire and Rain Season 5 Episode 511 aired March 9 2017. CMTCourtesy Everett Collection.
Straight from the beginning it was like Im dating a football player and then Juliette dates a football player. And then they turned her into an alcoholic Panettiere noted. Then they turned to her leaving her daughter and going to this crazy place in Europe and it was very obvious  They werent doing their homework. They werent creating new storylines. Those blurred lines were pretty confusing because they gave the Heroes star no relief from the burdens of swirling life.
They were just looking at my life and going Oh lets just take what shes going through and put our little spin on it. And then ta-da Its done and done she added. The long days on set resulted in her mental health declining rapidly. I didnt have time to take care of myself and to think about and go through the pain I was experiencing physically and emotionally Panettiere explained. She had to relive her daily struggles on and off the set. I was like tear central. I dont even think on a soap opera that I cried as much as I did on Nashville she said.
Panettiere first shared her struggles with her fans in 2022 after she revealed that her years as a child star caused enormous pressure. Her heavy drinking began in her early 20s as a way to self-soothe. I was being told how to be and how to live by so many people in my life she told Womens Health. I wanted certain decisions to be my own and nobody could stop me. What I put in my body was like an act of defiance.
After the birth of her daughter Kaya in 2014 the downward spiral took on a frenetic pace as her PPD and opioid addiction added another layer to her problems. By 2018 her on-and-off battle with substance abuse led to her losing custody of her daughter to Klitschko which she described to Red Table Talk as the most heartbreaking thing shes ever faced.

Before you go click here to see celebrities who have struggled with drug or alcohol addiction.
In mid-October a 29-year-old man was overdosing. His friends rushed him to an Ashland City emergency room.
He survived and he was released that night after receiving treatment.
Cheatham County Sheriffs Lt. Shannon Heflin said the man and two other people had purchased drugs from Haley Smith 26 of Ashland City and the victim thought he was snorting cocaine which ended up being a combination of heroin and fentanyl.
In a new twist for criminal justice in Tennessee Smith now faces charges of attempted second-degree murder possessing schedule I drugs and possession of drug paraphernalia in connection to the near-fatal overdose.
Just over a month later the Cheatham County Sheriffs Office reported four overdoses in one weekend one of which was fatal.
Evidence related to that overdose the death of a 30-year-old Chapmansboro man led the Cheatham County Sheriffs Office to Christopher Stefko 39 on Nov. 25.
Investigators believe Stefko traveled from Nashville to Cheatham County to sell drugs to the victim. Undercover investigators arranged another heroin deal then arrested Stefko and took him to the Cheatham County Jail.
In addition to drug charges Stefko has been charged with second-degree murder.
Holding dealers accountable
Murder charges against alleged drug dealers in fatal or near-fatal drug overdoses has become increasingly common in recent years in Tennessee where opioid deaths increased 12 percent in 2016.
The Drug Policy Alliance points out that other states including Delaware Kansas and Wyoming among others also have drug-induced homicide laws.
They need to know if you sell something and somebody dies you can be held accountable Metro Nashville Police Lt. Carlos Lara said previously. And you can be held accountable for their death. ... Were hoping itll make them think twice about dealing these drugs.
Prosecuting such cases is a tool that can deter people from dispensing and using opioids said Sumner County District Attorney Ray Whitley.
Cheatham County District Attorney Ray Crouch said he knew of several cases like these prosecuted in his district in recent years and the number will continue to rise.
The 2010 Tennessee Code specifies that second-degree murder could be defined in part as the killing of another that results from the unlawful distribution of any Schedule I or Schedule II drug when the drug is the proximate cause of the death of the user.
Crouch said since the statute was amended there's been a huge uptick in drug-related homicide charges particularly since opioid deaths have increased on a national scale.
State officials reported at least 1451 drug overdose deaths in Tennessee in 2015 though the actual number is likely higher by the hundreds a previous USA TODAY NETWORK  Tennessee report found.
The following year the estimate jumped to at least 1631 drug overdose deaths statewide according to the Tennessee Department of Health.
In Cheatham County more than 90 heroin overdoses  including more than five deaths  have been reported from January through September.
State data show deaths from fentanyl a synthetic opioid upped from 169 in 2015 to 294 in 2016 a previous report states.
Crouch said he believes prosecuting dealers selling fentanyl  That's what's killing everybody  with murder charges will have a deterring effect.
Lesser charges such as sale of a controlled substance could land the offender anything from a misdemeanor to a low-level felony he said whereas the minimum time serving a second-degree murder sentence is 15 years.
Crouch said the biggest challenge to prosecuting drug-induced homicide cases is whether there was a proper death scene investigation.
If law enforcement officials initially responding to the scene don't recognize drug overdose symptoms he said then the body might not be properly examined and there might not even be an autopsy performed.
I do think several overdose deaths have gone by in Tennessee where someone could have been charged Crouch said though he credited law enforcement officials for becoming more aware of the problem noting that he's seeing improvement in investigations.

Healthy Tennessee will hold a summit entitled Working Together to Solve the Opioid Crisis.
This summit is the first of its kind and will be focused on solutions collaboration and action.
Manny Sethi M.D. is president of Healthy Tennessee and is an orthopaedic trauma surgeon.
Tennessee has become a hot bed destination for tourism in recent years but unfortunately we have also become a haven for opioid abuse leading to a record number of deaths in the Volunteer State.
The numbers attributed to the opioid crisis are staggering. Just this week the Tennessee Department of Health reported that drug overdose deaths killed more Tennesseans than ever before a trend that has been repeated for six years in a row.
Tennessee has one of the highest opioid overdose death rates in the country. Three people die every day in Tennessee due to opioids  more than traffic-related fatalities.
The opioid crisis is not just a rural problem as 1-in-5 opioid overdose deaths in 2016 were right here in Davidson County. In fact deaths involving fentanyl an incredibly potent synthetic opioid are up 70 percent since last year. Fentanyl is sometimes found in counterfeits illegally smuggled in to our country and has now surpassed heroin now as the deadliest drug in Nashville.
The opioid crisis also has had an economic impact on our state as the University of Tennessee found that there is a direct correlation between opioid use unemployment and a decline in labor force participation.
Building a healthy Tennessee and fighting this opioid epidemic we face are directly linked. Almost a decade ago my wife Maya and I started Healthy Tennessee with the goal of improving health across Tennessee.
Harnessing the power of local communities and hundreds of volunteers we conducted health fairs in small towns and large cities across our great state. But one thing we quickly realized is that all too often organizations like Healthy Tennessee and others operate in silos where one hand does not know what the other is doing.
In other words our state has many important and effective community health organizations but we often tend to duplicate efforts as we dont collaborate or communicate.
Collaboration is key to breaking the silo
To try and break down these silos over the past two years we have partnered with the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee Health Foundation to bring over 150 organizations together in summits across Tennessee.
Through these efforts we developed a better sense of community and developed shared goals forging the path toward a powerful network of community health organizations across our state.
For example from these meetings came the concept of creating the first of its kind statewide list-serve to connect stakeholders from Memphis to Mountain City breaking down silos with one click.
Through our health fairs and summits across Tennessee we have seen firsthand the impact opioid addiction has had in every corner of our state. We have met with incredible organizations and individuals who are committed to solve the opioid crisis but face the same challenges I mention above  working in silos .
Across Tennessee when it comes to prevention treatment and rehabilitation of opioid addiction we are often at the cutting edge. But to ultimately end the opioid crisis it will take more than any single action and will require a collaborative effort from all stakeholders involved there is no magic bullet.
As we have done previously for community health organizations I felt Healthy Tennessee needed to take the next step to collaborate on a more granular level and have these committed individuals and organizations from across the state together under one roof to develop strategies and action plans to solve the opioid crisis in Tennessee once and for all.
First of its kind summit will address and create solutions
This week Healthy Tennessee will hold a summit entitled Working Together to Solve the Opioid Crisis. This summit is the first of its kind in our state and will be focused on solutions collaboration and action.
The summit will include faith leaders law enforcement elected officials the private sector and non-profit organizations who are working on the front lines to solve the opioid crisis.
We are bringing together these individuals and groups to collaborate and understand how they can work together to ultimately solve the opioid crisis in Tennessee and beyond.
The summit will also hear from candidates for statewide office  Congressman Marsha Blackburn former Governor Phil Bredesen former Nashville Mayor Karl Dean and businessman Bill Lee  to hear how they will collaborate with these individuals and organizations to solve this crisis if elected in November.
My hope is that this summit will be an important next step to break down silos open lines of communications across the state and renew a sense of collaboration to ensure that Tennessee becomes a leader in solving the opioid crisis.

NASHVILLE Tenn. AP  A former Tennessee correctional officer will receive 160000 in back pay and damages after he was forced to resign for taking Suboxone to treat his opioid use disorder if a judge approves a landmark consent decree filed in federal court in Nashville on Wednesday.
It is the first time the U.S. Department of Justice has used the Americans with Disabilities Act to settle a claim that an employee was discriminated against for taking a prescribed medication to treat drug addiction according to the Department.
It comes less than a year after the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division issued new guidelines advising that employers health care providers law enforcement agencies that operate jails and others are violating the ADA if they discriminate against people taking prescription medications to treat opioid use disorder. The Department noted federal law does not protect people who are using illegal drugs.
In the present case the complainant who is not identified by name was hired as a correctional officer at the Cumberland County jail in January 2015. He received positive employment evaluations and was even promoted but when a drug screen showed he was taking Suboxone to treat his opioid addiction in 2018 he was given the choice of resigning or being fired for drug use.
The complaint filed in federal court Wednesday claims a Cumberland Countys sheriffs office policy prohibiting employees from being on controlled substances while at work fails to make individualized assessments of its employees ability to perform the essential functions of their jobs ... when they are taking legally prescribed medications.
In addition to providing 160000 to the former employee the county has agreed to revise its employment policies and implement training around ADA compliance as part of a consent decree also filed Wednesday. The decree wont become final until approved by a judge. An initial case management conference is scheduled for Friday.
Drugs like Suboxone often carry a stigma because they contain opioids but Dr. Marc Stern a correctional physician who is on faculty at the University of Washington School of Public Health said they should not.
When these drugs are prescribed for someone who has a disorder it helps them be normal. It helps them be healthy. It helps them to hold a job Stern said. More importantly the Department of Justice has spoken and this is the law. Its not up to employers to decide whether they like it or not.
Because of how opioids act on the brain people dependent on them get sick if they stop using. Withdrawal can feel like a bad flu with cramping sweating anxiety and sleeplessness. Cravings for the drug can last for years and be so intense that relapse is common. Suboxone is a common form of buprenorphine a gold standard medicine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that reduces cravings.
Overdose deaths in the U.S. remain at near-record levels. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that overdoses contributed to more than 107000 deaths in the 12 months that ended Aug. 31. Opioids were involved in more than 81000 of those.
The proposed consent decree in Tennessee comes as President Joe Bidens administration pushes for greater access to addiction treatment. Most recently Biden signed a law eliminating the need for doctors to get a special waiver to prescribe buprenorphine. He has also released a national drug control strategy that for the first time prioritizes preventing death and illness in drug users while trying to engage them in care and treatment.

NASHVILLE Tenn.  Mayor Megan Barry heard a knock at her door at 3 a.m. on Sunday July 30.
Your first thought is that you've had a police officer who's been injured she said and you need to get dressed you need to go to the hospital and you need to comfort the family.
Instead she was the one who would need comforting. The officers at the door told her it was her son who had just died of a suspected overdose in Denver hours earlier.
Barry told NBC News Wednesday her son had a combination of drugs in his system when he died of an overdose 10 days ago.
She said the drugs included Xanax cocaine and the opioids methadone and hydromorphone. The autopsy report showed the cause of death as combined drug intoxication.
I didn't see it coming Barry said  even though Max Barry 22 had been to rehab once before in Florida for abusing Xanax. Hed recently graduated from the University of Puget Sound and moved to Colorado.
He was our only child she said. I want to just shake him and say 'What were you thinking'

At an emotional memorial service last week the mayor's husband Bruce remembered his son.
We've all made incredible mistakes that we could almost always walk away from he said. He made one he couldn't walk away from.
Barry returned to work for the first time on Monday and she has decided to take her story public.
It's definitely part of my new normal she said. To bring awareness to this because I don't want this to happen to anybody else.
In Nashville alone last year there were 245 deadly overdoses involving opioids the mayors office said. Thats a 120 percent jump from the year before.
On Tuesday President Trump stopped short of declaring a national emergency  but pledged to ramp up law enforcement to combat the crisis.
We're not going to arrest our way out of this problem Barry said. You need having access to beds and treatment. Treating this like a disease by declaring a federal emergency  we would get those resources that we need.

This hole that I have in my heart will never be filled she said. And I reach for my phone because like most 22-year-olds we texted a lot.
She shared their final texts just hours before her sons death.
I'm so grateful that the last words we said were I love you and I love you too Mom.
In 2015 state officials reported at least 1451 men women and children died from drug overdoses in Tennessee - but that's far from an accurate count.
There are likely hundreds more. No one knows the true number.
Drug deaths reported in Tennessee are fundamentally flawed and represent an under-count of the toll taken by opioids the nations most deadly drug epidemic a USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee investigation found.

There are so many levels at which the data breaks down that we dont know what we dont know said Dr. Adele Lewis deputy state chief medical examiner.
There is no doubt we are under-counting them overdose deaths. There is no way that number is reality.'
A long-standing problem
The opioid overdose crisis is highlighting a longstanding problem of unreliable death investigations that is particularly acute in rural areas that do not have trained forensic pathologists  the same areas where opioids have taken the largest toll.
Without an accurate count lawmakers public health officials and law enforcement have no way of knowing the extent of the problem and how to combat it.
The investigation found that the states 95 county medical examiners who lack training in forensic medicine and are paid very little or work for free take different approaches to investigating and recording causes of death.

In rural Unicoi County for example the coroner heads to the scene of every suspicious drug death searching for pill bottles and interviewing relatives. Unicoi's coroner Ed Herndon believes state law requires him to order autopsies on every suspected overdose death. It doesnt  although autopsies are strongly recommended.
In contrast Campbell Countys longtime medical examiner Dr. E.G. Cline relies on a phone call from local police to describe a death scene. He rarely orders autopsies or toxicology tests that would determine all of the drugs in a person's body to include on a death certificate because he says the only point of the death certificate is to declare the person dead.
Death certificates are the single critical source of information on causes of death.
Money also plays a factor in undercounting overdose deaths.
Autopsies are the most accurate way of determining whether someone died from an overdose.
But they are expensive costing most counties between 1600 and 2000. Many of the county examiners who spoke to USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee echoed Dr. Tom Thompson the medical examiner in Hamblen County If we autopsied every overdose the county would go broke.
Medical examiners are only one link in a chain of individuals who are responsible for identifying overdose deaths.
Before medical examiners get involved in a death they must get a call from police or hospitals to flag a suspicious death that requires an investigation.
Those deaths can go unreported when a person succumbs to a heart attack pneumonia or other illnesses that result from prescription drug abuse. Those deaths should be recorded as opioid-related  but often get categorized as natural.

When medical examiners do order autopsies a body is sent to one of the states five forensic centers where trained forensic pathologists perform them.
The five centers send bodily fluids for testing to three different privately-owned toxicology labs which each test for a different panel of drugs.
A growing national concern
Tennessee is not alone. A working group convened by the White House in 2016 released a report in December noting more than 50 federal programs rely on often-faulty cause-of-death data to create policy.
The group called for strengthening of the nation's fragmented system for investigating deaths noting the need has become increasingly urgent given the sharp rise in deaths involving prescription medication and illicit drugs.
Many parts of the country are experiencing deaths in epidemic proportions as a result of the opioid and heroin crisis while mortality data to inform government policy and programmatic response remains inadequate the report said.

In Tennessee the problem is exacerbated by paper records instead of an electronic death registration system that would prompt medical examiners to enter more detailed information. Lewis said state officials hope to have one by next year. Tennessee is one of the few states that lacks one.
Medical examiners take inconsistent approaches
Dr. Scott Portis serves as medical examiner for Benton County and assistant medical examiner for neighboring Henry County. At 76 he hoped to retire to his cabin on Kentucky Lake years ago but there is no one to take his place.
I tried to quit but the mayor said 'I don't know who would take this on' said Portis a former emergency room director and family practitioner.
By state law all medical examiners must be physicians. Most are family practitioners - whose full time job is taking care of live people  not heading out to crime scenes or interpreting toxicology reports. Most are paid very little for the extra duties. In Lewis County Sen. Joey Hensley volunteers as medical examiner in addition to his job as state lawmaker and local physician.
In two counties long-serving coroners without medical degrees were allowed to retain their positions when state rules changed.
In the state's largest cities medical examiners are full-time forensic pathologists who perform autopsies and have a staff of professional death investigators who visit each suspicious death scene.
But in the majority of Tennessee's 95 mostly-rural counties medical examiners are local doctors given little training beyond a handbook of rules and guidelines to follow.
Portis estimates that 30 to 40 percent of deaths in Benton County are drug overdoses. To determine cause of death he sends bodily fluids to a lab in Nashville for toxicology tests. To help save the county money Portis said he consciously reduced the number of autopsies. Before he was medical examiner the county was paying for 30 or 40 autopsies a year. So far this year he has ordered just four.
If we think they overdosed there's no sense in ordering an autopsy because it will cost us 2000 and the toxicology report is 200-400 Portis said. It would break the county if we got an autopsy on every drug overdose. We are very prudent in spending the county's money.
Autopsies are the most effective way of determining cause of death according to Lewis. They are recommended for every suspected overdose death in Tennessee but not required.
A Knox County report on drug deaths last year noted that while the number of autopsies increased by 25 percent over six years the number of known drug-related cases had doubled.
Relying only on toxicology tests requires a level of training that most of the state's medical examiners lack Lewis said. Drugs metabolize at different rates. A person who has developed a tolerance for one prescription drug may test at what would be lethal rates for other individuals.
Small counties rising autopsy costs
Deaths are expensive for local communities. Counties that routinely order autopsies for drug overdoses have seen sharp increases in costs. In Bradley County for example where there were 18 drug related deaths this year by the end of July the autopsy budget of 68000 was exhausted by mid-year. Laura Wittmaier director of the medical examiner's office requested an additional 30000.
 Read moreOpioid crisis 'knows no bounds' says Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price
A handful of counties in northeast Tennessee who rely on the East Tennessee State University forensic center for autopsies have switched to a different fee model for autopsies. Instead of paying a per-body fee the counties pay an annual flat rate based on their population. In Washington County that has meant the medical examiner does not hesitate in ordering an autopsy on a suspected overdose.
The number of autopsies has ballooned said Washington County Mayor Dan Eldridge.
Inconsistent death records
The nation's death data is compiled by the Centers for Disease Control which relies on cause of death to track public health trends such as the number of people dying from diabetes heart disease or overdoses.
In overdose cases the CDC can track specific trends - such as a rise in opioid or heroin use. But only if medical examiners include the information on the death certificate.
USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee found medical examiners across the state take a vastly different approach to filling out death certificates.
Bradley County Medical Examiner Jeffrey Miller has typically written polypharmacy overdose for deaths in which multiple drugs are involved said Wittmaier who noted that lately he's gotten better at listing specific drugs.
Portis lists all identified drugs on the death certificate. Joe Fite medical examiner for Giles County does not. Instead writes prescription drug toxicity and notes all specific drugs on a separate form sent to the department of health that does not get included in death data.
Medical examiners also vary in noting the manner of death for suspected drug overdoses.
 After the ODKnox County looks at hiring post-naloxone case manager
In Bradley County the medical examiner typically categorizes overdose deaths as accidents unless there is clear evidence of suicide. In Benton County they are suicides if lethal drug doses are present. In Hamblen County Thompson takes the unusual step of classifying the majority of overdose deaths as natural because he said death is a natural progression of the disease of addiction.
Lewis strongly disagrees with that. Any death from external causes is not natural she said.
Medical examiners also face the challenge of synthetic drugs that are so new there is no test for them.
Last year for the first time in my career I put down as cause of death an 'unknown toxic substance secondary to addiction' said Thompson the medical examiner in Hamblen County. We knew he overdosed. Despite our best efforts we couldn't come up with what he overdosed on. We don't know what it is. We are getting synthetic drugs from China.
A study released this year by the University of Virginia found a specific drug was not listed in 19.5 percent of all overdose deaths. The lack of specificity on death certificates could mean overdose deaths are undercounted by as much as 24 percent nationwide the report concluded.
Hospitals don't report
In August 2015 the Knox County Regional Forensic Center issued an 81-page analysis of deaths in the region over a five-year period.
The report noted that it could not account for all deaths highlighting the lack of reporting by hospitals as one factor. When individuals die in hospitals and then required cremation local medical examiners are required to certify cause of death.
In some cases those requests prompted suspicion on the part of medical examiners who then sent bodies for autopsy. The Knox County facility found some were actually drug-related deaths.
The report urged state officials to implement a training program for hospitals and physicians to assure their understanding of reporting requirements and to create a system to hold these groups accountable for accurately reporting deaths.
A study by the CDC of Minnesota deaths released in April found that a significant number of opioid related deaths were wrongly recorded as pneumonia or other infectious diseases.
New approaches to collecting data
Lewis and her colleagues are working to address the problem by providing training to medical examiners and by painstakingly reviewing not only death certificates but supporting records with the goal of providing a more accurate count next year.
They have resorted to paying counties 25 per death to provide detailed forensic reports that help give state health officials a clearer picture of overdose deaths by 2018.
 Editorial National opioid epidemic emergency declaration will save lives
About 45 counties have begun complying according to Lewis. State law has long required medical examiners to submit those reports but many don't Lewis said.
Lewis said addressing the problem also requires money.
Small counties can't absorb the cost of numerous autopsies but the state could appropriate funding to ease that burden.
Knowing how a life was lost is important not only for public policy but for loved ones trying to make sense of a tragedy.
Families need closure said Lewis who has worked with death as a forensic pathologist for 16 years.

Health care professionals in Tennessee last year wrote more than 7.8 million opioid prescriptions  or 1.18 for every man woman and child  even as the state grapples with a scourge of painkiller addiction and abuse.
The total places Tennessee second in the nation behind only Alabama in prescriptions of the drugs according to IMS Health data. Even though the number of scripts has fallen by 724070 since 2013 when there were over 8.5 million total prescriptions the state remains ensconced as a leader in prescribing oxycodone hydrocodone and Percocet.
The state along with the nation is in an opioid epidemic. In 2014 still the latest year available 1263 Tennesseans died from opioid overdose  be it painkillers or heroin  a figure that outpaces those who died in car accidents or from firearms.
But what does 7800947 prescriptions mean Why are there so many prescriptions And why wont prescribers just stop writing them
There are 6.5 million people living in Tennessee and there are 38.8 million people living in California where there was 0.48 prescriptions in 2015 for every person.
I truly do not believe that we are skewed toward a higher level of pain or a lower level of pain tolerance than the rest of the country said Dr. Richard Soper of the Center for Behavioral Wellness in Nashville.
The answer to the chagrin of policymakers in all corners of health care is a combination of several factors including accepted medical practice and education successful pharmaceutical advertising campaigns insurance benefit coverage structure and patient lifestyle. There are also several layers of economic dependence.
Pro-painkiller echo chamber shaped policy amid drug epidemic
Its hard to pinpoint one bad actor or even a single group of bad actors when every part of the system and society needs to be examined said Soper noting how he's bombarded with drug ads when he watches TV.
There are consistently positive signs that prescribing habits are changing and that the state is making in-roads into the epidemic said Dr. David Reagan chief medical officer of the Tennessee Department of Health.
Tennessee was one of four states to receive the making progress designation in a recent report from the National Safety Council on efforts to curb opioid abuse and misuse. It met five of six criteria no state met all six.
Drugmakers fought state opioid limits amid crisis
The health department has asked physicians to write prescriptions with fewer doses so there are fewer leftover pills. Its important to balance the legitimate uses of the painkillers against the crackdown on prescriptions said Reagan.
The state monitors the morphine milligram equivalent or MME a unit that compares the strength of opioids into the potency of morphine more than it watches the number of prescriptions.
Over the last four years the number of prescribed MMEs have dropped by two billion from 9.16 billion MMEs in 2012 to 7.83 MMEs in 2015. Theres been a decrease in every county according to health department data.
We believe we are lowering the amount that ends up in peoples medicine cabinets Reagan said.
Physician and prescriber education is essential in curbing the rate of prescription. Medical schools are beginning to focus more on pain treatment  its historically been a tiny component in the curriculum unless the student opts to become a pain specialist.
Opioid lobby spends big on Tennessee politics
Schools are beginning to incorporate more into programs and there are efforts to boost pain education offerings in the continuing education options for physicians said Reagan who described the existing offerings as very modest. Dr. David Edwards a pain specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center said the medical school is rethinking its pain curriculum there are other efforts taking shape around the state.
Opioid prescriptions are here to stay.
Pain treatment has to be individualized for each patient and opioids are often the best choice for getting people through surgery recovery experts said.
But there need to be more alternative treatments such as physical therapy easily accessed and have reasonable coverage in insurance plans Reagan and Edwards said. Generic opioids are cheaper than newer drugs or alternative therapies that may have limited coverage under someones insurance benefits.
Edwards is working with a patient who after being on opioids for about 10 years and being in her 80s to wean her off the prescription using first aquatherapy then regular physical in conjunction with other types of pain medications. He was concerned other side effects would negatively impact her health as she ages. Shes made good progress over the course of the year but is in limbo until 2017 when her physical therapy allotments reset he said.
Doctors also have to grapple with the expectations of the people sitting in the exam rooms which influence what they want out of a visit and what they accept as satisfactory treatment.
Patients have come to equate a successful visit with a page from the doctor's prescription pad whether it's an antibiotic to help a winter cold or a painkiller for a weekend injury said Natalie Tate vice president of pharmacy management at BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee.
People have expectations about living without pain which became known as the fifth vital sign in the 1990s.
Reagan said there is not enough talk about functionality and what it takes to ensure people can do what they need and want to in life.
There is the expectation or the hope that the pain will be gone so you dont have to think about that. Part of that is just human nature. Part of it is American society looking to medicine for a quick fix said Edwards. Pain doctors we dont necessarily cure any kind of pain. We think of it like diabetes. You have a problem or a disease that needs to be managed. If people dont want to harm their kidneys they manage their diabetes really closely. If you have chronic pain it may be there the rest of your life.

How experts would change the fight against opioid pervasiveness
Dr. David Edwards a pain specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center
I would say that take a little less pressure off the patients and put a little more onus on the prescribers. I would require the creation of educational tools for the alternatives to opioids. Every prescriber should be educated or re-educated on what the alternatives are in addition to safe prescribing guidelines and having the controlled substance monitoring database link to other states.
Dr. David Reagan chief medical officer of the Tennessee Department of Health
I honestly think the most important things are being able to destigmatize substance abuse disorders so we can talk about them openly and we dont ostracize people who are impacted by them. If we thought about it fundamentally like diabetes or cancer we wouldnt spend time moralizing over whether actions put people at risk.
Dr. Richard Soper an addiction specialist with Center for Behavioral Wellness in Nashville.
Having a regular forum for health care law enforcement media and community leaders every quarter or so would help increase an open dialogue and move toward an environment that doesnt punish people for coming to medical professionals for help. The state needs more in-patient beds to treat addiction.
Natalie Tate vice president of pharmacy management at BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee
It cant just be from a prescription management change for example that we may do here or it cant be us only talking with physicians. There needs to be an acute awareness that this is a public health crisis for us across the state and the long-term consequences  even though I dont know if we fully recognize the extent at this point. Its not really a policy but a public awareness that its critical for us to be successful.
NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  It's a heartbreaking statistic in the year 2022 nearly 4000 Tennesseans died from a drug overdose. Lawmakers are hoping to pass legislation that can bring that number down significantly. But figuring out that solution drew a lot of debate Tuesday on Tennessee's Capitol Hill.
Brittany's Law
Jessica Francis a Maury County resident testified on behalf of Brittany's Law.
My sister passed away on June 12 2023. My sister died while laying in a camper for hours. 10 other people were there and didnt seek help Francis said. If you are going to let someone die wheres your humanity
The bill would make it a criminal offense if someone knowingly failed to seek medical assistance for someone overdosing. It would be a misdemeanor offense. But experts worry the bill could do the exact opposite.
Its well intended. Unfortunately its very likely to backfire testified Elliot Pinsley CEO of the Behavioral Health Foundation. We want bystanders to call 911 as quickly as possible and having to worry about when immunity might apply versus when a criminal penalty might apply is not something we want people thinking about when were trying to save a life.
Melody Clark who lost her daughter to a fatal overdose agreed.
I just feel like this is going in the opposite direction of the Good Samaritan law. I feel like these people need to know they can call and not get into trouble for saving someones life said Clark who lives in Signal Mountain.
Many of the House Criminal Justice Subcommittee lawmakers felt like the bill was well-intentioned but ultimately decided that the unintended consequences were just too great. How do you define and criminalize that Its so hard said Rep. William Lamberth R-Portland who serves as House Majority Leader.
To expect one of those persons to make a judgment call that sound I think is really stretching it said Rep. Bud Hulsey R-Kingsport who is retired law enforcement.
Ultimately the support just wasn't there. All but one member Rep. G.A. Hardaway D-Memphis voted against the measure. But the bill sponsor Rep. Scott Cepicky R-Culleoka hopes finding a solution will remain a number one priority.
Members if this isnt the solution I understand that. Okay. Then what is asked Cepicky.
Other Opioid Epidemic Bills and Ideas
Rep. Yusef Hakeem and Sen. Heidi Campbellhave a bill that would require a prescribing healthcare practitioner to discuss certain risks associated with prescribing opiates.
Elliot Pinsley who testified Tuesday against Brittany's Law suggested that the best way to save lives would be to add exceptions to Tennessee's Good Samaritan Law. The measure which passed in 2015 has a provision that only gives one criminal exception to someone who has previously overdosed. He thinks giving full immunity to those trying to save others from an overdose would encourage everyone to seek help.
Meredith Lawrence
Guest Columnist
There have recently been a few minor stories about the closing of Comprehensive Pain Specialists clinics across the region due to financial issues and a federal criminal investigation. Some have even mentioned that an estimated 45000 pain patients are now without a pain management doctor.
If this were 45000 cancer patients not receiving treatment in the weeks to come it would be headline news. People would be up in arms over that denial of care.
If you or somebody you love have not been directly impacted by long-term chronic pain then you are very fortunate. Keep in mind that we are all just one car accident away from that condition.
A car accident in the early 1980s is the reason my husband Jay developed chronic pain. The backlash against opiate addiction and the ill-conceived U.S. Centers for Disease Control response to that is what caused him to end his life.
MoreThe race against pain As clinics close patients need new doctors before pills run out
Jay was young and strong enough not immediately to need pain medications to manage his back injury. He dealt with his pain until his condition degenerated and he was forced to have three back surgeries in 2007 and 2008. It was at this point that he was started on low dosages of pain medications. As time went on he developed some tolerance to these medications.
He worked with a doctor to make sure that he was on the lowest possible dosage that would allow him to maintain some quality of life. He also allowed them to do any other procedure they thought necessary beyond just prescribing medications. This included implanting a device in his side that delivered a constant dosage of medication.
The back injury did not allow him to work and it severely limited him in many ways. A good day was as simple as being able to take our dogs for a walk or to go to the grocery store with me. A bad day would leave my strong fiercely-independent husband in so much pain he would sit in his chair and sob.
Turn to illegal drugs suffer or suicide
We were introduced to the CDC guidelines after Tennessee adopted their version of these in early 2017.
These were guidelines only not laws Tennessee passed an opioid law in 2018 that outlined that patients on long term ongoing care with opioid medications must be seen by a pain care provider. The CDC guidelines go further by recommending a lower dosage a pain care specialist can prescribe.
My introduction to these guidelines came when Comprehensive Pain Specialists told my husband they were cutting his medications by 75 percent. The reason that we were given was that eventually the guidelines might become law. The last thing the doctor said to my husband was My patients quality of life is not worth risking my practice or my license over.
It did not matter to them that my husband was not abusing his medication or that he had been their patient for over five years. It did not matter how drastically they were reducing his quality of life.
Rather than face the unbearable pain that losing his medication would cause him my husband chose to end his life and I supported that decision.
What concerns me most about the closing of these pain clinics can be summed up in what my husband told me after they reduced his medications. He told me he felt like he had been given three choices. He could turn to illegal drugs he could suffer unimaginable pain or he could end his life.
These are the choices now faced by the 45000 impacted by these closures. Imagine if just 1 percent of these people choose the same option he did. That would mean 450 deaths 450 families without a loved one 450 funerals.
Is that what we really want for people with chronic pain Is that what you want for yourself or somebody that you love What other options are there for these 45000 patients
Looking at it now seeing these clinics closing you can see that the patients just do not mean anything to the doctors or some of our legislators.
My question for you the reader and our legislators now is quite simple. What are we going to do to prevent any more suicides
What are we going to do to take care of these patients
How are we going to provide them treatment before any more lives are lost
Meredith Lawrence is a former resident of Hendersonville Tenn. She now resides Gainesville Ga.
Tennessee Alabama and South Carolina lead the nation in arresting and criminally punishing women for allegedly posing a danger to their fetuses according to a report released by advocacy group Pregnancy Justice.
Nationwide nearly 1400 people were arrested or subject to disparate bail sentencing and probation for conduct related to their pregnancies between 2005 and the Supreme Court decision in June 2022 dismantling abortion rights the report found. The vast majority were poor white women though poor Black women were disproportionately represented.
Tennessee accounted for 131 of those cases.
Pregnant people have been criminalized at an accelerating rate for actions that would not be illegal but for a persons pregnancy Lourdes Rivera president of Pregnancy Justice told reporters on Tuesday.
The report shows a substantial increase in the number of people being charged for crimes tied to pregnancy. In 2013 Pregnancy Justice released a report that found that law enforcement had targeted 413 pregnant people between 1973  which marked the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion  and 2005. The new findings show those instances have tripled.
When we talk about back alley or secret abortions thats not the real risk to peoples lives.  Nina Gurek Healthy and Free Tennessee
Advocates pointed to two key drivers in criminalizing pregnancy the expansion of so-called fetal rights or personhood laws and a more punitive approach to substance use among pregnant women  even as many states move to decriminalize drug abuse in line with evolving approaches to addiction. The majority of criminal cases documented by Pregnancy Justice related to substance use including marijuana cocaine or methamphetamines. In about one-quarter of these cases the substance was legal such as nicotine alcohol or prescription opiates.
In Tennessee both factors hold true. Tennessee law says that life begins at conception.
Tennessee also became the first state in the nation to enact a fetal assault law. Enacted in 2014 the law allowed women to be prosecuted for drug use during pregnancy. The measure was criticized by state and national health and advocacy groups and was allowed to expire in 2016. Several efforts to reimplement the law have been introduced in the Tennessee Legislature since.
Nina Gurek policy director for Healthy and Free Tennessee said that despite the laws expiration her organization continues to hear of prosecutions involving pregnant women on child abuse or neglect charges involving legal and illegal substance use allegations.
We know its still happening she said.
The Pregnancy Justice report warns that more people could face criminal charges or increased bonds or sentencing as states have enacted abortion bans and restrictions.
Tennessees strict abortion ban explicitly exempts pregnant women from prosecution for seeking abortions.
But Gurek said she places no trust in the laws protections.
When we talk about back alley or secret abortions thats not the real risk to peoples lives said Nina Gurek policy director for Healthy and Free Tennessee. Its handcuffs.
A recent study by Forbes Advisor determined that Tennessee is among the states with the least healthy populations in the country.
The study was based on rates of chronic diseases drug abuse and unhealthy lifestyle habits.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention six in 10 adults in the United States suffer from one chronic disease with four in 10 adults suffering from two. The key lifestyle risks for chronic disease include tobacco use poor nutrition lack of physical activity and excessive alcohol use said the CDC.
The CDC defines chronic diseases as conditions that last one year or more and require ongoing medical attention or limit activities of daily living or both. For example heart disease cancer or diabetes.
Eight of the 10 least healthy states are Southern states West Virginia Mississippi Tennessee Arkansas Kentucky Alabama Louisiana and Oklahoma.

Metro Police have arrested three people connected to a woman's overdose death last year.
Police say 43-year-old Jamie Hughes overdosed and died inside her Belmont-Hillsboro home in Dec. 2022.
An investigation found three people  Tamara Sue Morales 56 her daughter Alexandra Guerriero 31 and Guerrieros boyfriend Maxwell Delancy 33  had contact with Hughes and conspired together to sell her a powder substance laced with fentanyl. All of the suspects are from Middle Tennessee.
Police say the narcotic sale is believed to have taken place at a motel on Wallace Road on Dec. 21 2022. Hughes was found dead inside her home the next day.
Metro Police released the following information regarding the case on Friday
Delancy was taken into custody Thursday afternoon at a Hermitage area motel after detectives from the Hermitage Precincts Field Intelligence Team spotted him at an area gas station and followed the vehicle to the motel. The driver Kelando Cato 42 was wanted on an outstanding warrant charging him with especially aggravated robbery in connection with the shooting of a 35-year-old woman during a carjacking on Ocala Drive on January 12th. At the time of his arrest Thursday Cato was carrying a loaded semi-automatic pistol and fentanyl. In addition to the outstanding especially aggravated robbery warrant Cato was also charged with unlawful gun possession by a convicted felon Cato has aggravated assault and felony cocaine convictions in his past gun possession during the commission of a dangerous drug felony and possession of fentanyl for resale.

After she beat back opioid addiction she devoted her short life to helping others do the same.
Tennessee addiction recovery advocate Bethany Bessy Morse 34 died Feb. 2 at her home in Nashville. Friends said Ms. Morse died unexpectedly after experiencing several spells of hypoglycemia or very low blood sugar which research suggests may be more common in people who have battled drug addiction.
Ms. Morse found recovery four years ago at Nashville's Renewal House a program for young mothers and their children. After getting clean Ms. Morse pursued a bachelor's degree in social work which she was one semester away from obtaining from Tennessee State University.
But she did not wait for a degree to do the work of helping others. Ms. Morse devoted her sobriety to trying to pull others out of the grips of addiction becoming a statewide NarCan trainer and distributor with the nonprofit Tennessee Overdose Prevention meeting with Tennessee and Mississippi legislators to offer firsthand accounts of the opioid crisis ministering to Nashville's homeless population and administering the 3500-plus-member Memphis' War on Heroin Facebook page offering support and helping obtain treatment for families.

She was an angel here on earth wrote Tina Garcia one of many friends who posted on a Facebook page devoted to Ms. Morse's memory. The instant she became part of our life everything changed. She loved those with an addiction when they couldn't love themselves. She gave them hope opportunity for a better life second third fifth 15th chances ... whatever it took. To us parents she held our hands gave us strength hope anything and everything we needed. When the days were hopeless she gave comfort. I truly do not know how she did it but she was ALWAYS there. For ALL of us. She saved countless lives.
Ms. Morse was one of the first to offer her image for a Tennessee Overdose Prevention billboard campaign proclaiming WeDoRecover. When asked whether she was embarrassed about her years as an addict and the impact on her family she said I could be embarrassed or I can use my story to help others. She shared her experience on banners and websites and at public events.
After the birth of her son Tyler now 5 who is autistic and nonverbal she became a fierce advocate for his needs as well as for the autism community as a whole.
Her life impacted so many people said Tennessee Overdose Prevention founder Nancy Carter Daniels. We all thought that we were her best friend.
In addition to the Facebook group Ms. Morse's friends created an Apple Music playlist of her favorite songs under her name. Her funeral  held Friday afternoon in her hometown of Tupelo Mississippi  was livestreamed on the internet and friends hoped to make a recording available for later viewing.

Police have arrested and charged a fourth person with second degree murder in connection with the fatal Fentanyl overdose of a 38-year-old woman in Hermitage last year.
Najir Ellis was arrested in Clarksville this week in connection with the death of Nicole Aylward.
Aylward died April 3 2015 from a Fentanyl and heroin overdose at Shannon Wise and Joseph Thompson's Central Pike apartment. Both Wise and Thompson were immediately charged with second degree murder and a number of felony drug charges.
Aylward had suffered a non-fatal overdose in that same apartment just days earlier.
Narcotics detectives say the two provided Aylward with the Fentanyl a prescription opioid typically used to manage severe pain.
As detectives continued to work on this case they identified Michael Lacefield 28 and Ellis 19 as the persons who originally sold and delivered the Fentanyl-laced heroin to the apartment according to police.
Lacefield was arrested last year.
Because Ellis was 17 years old when Aylward died police have charged him in juvenile court.
The second degree murder charges against Wise Thompson and Lacefield are pending in Davidson County criminal court police say. They're scheduled to appear in court Dec. 15.
Indicted in the same case on felony heroin charges is James Cooke 39 who police said shipped the Fentanyl-laced heroin from Detroit to Nashville.

The lawsuit alleged the Food City in Bearden sold enough pills to give 130 to every man woman and child in Knoxville. Food City denied the claims.

NASHVILLE Tenn.  Food City and the state of Tennessee announced both reached a settlement following a years-long lawsuit over alleged eye-popping opioid prescription numbers involving a store in Knoxville.
Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti announced a multi-million dollar settlement with Food City over its opioid-related misconduct on Thursday.
According to the attorney general most of the 44.5 million settlement will go to Tennessees Opioid Abatement Fund to support efforts addressing the opioid epidemic.
Every entity that contributed to the opioid crisis must be held accountable Skrmetti said. Our Consumer Protection Division remains relentless in the pursuit of justice and I am proud of their aggressive enforcement in this case. By paying a hefty price to resolve past misconduct Food City provides critical resources to save lives and protect families and can now get back to the business of serving its customers and supporting Tennessee communities.
Food City said the allegations from two cases in Knox and Sevier counties stemmed from circumstances from more than a decade ago saying it agreed to ensure future compliance by providing additional training to pharmacy staff updating the prescription-validation process and monitoring and reporting data related to suspicious activity the release said.
The AG said the settlement also included an agreement for Food City to provide employment opportunities for Tennesseans recovering from opioid addiction.
K-VA-T Food Stores Inc. Food City's parent company made a statement on the settlement below
K-VA-T Food Stores Inc. announced today that it has entered into an agreement to end two opioid-related cases in Knox County and Sevier County Tennessee. The cases are examples of thousands of cases nationwide brought against manufacturers distributors and retailers of prescription opioid products. The allegations in these two actions focus primarily on circumstances from more than a decade ago. K-VA-T has continually disputed any allegations of misconduct made in these actions. The agreement states that it is not an admission or evidence of any liability or wrongdoing. K-VA-T believes the settlement agreement is in the best interest of all parties and will contribute to the opioid-related programs that are being established as a result of the previous settlements with national retailers and distributors. K-VA-T is committed to the communities it serves and has pledged its support of local drug rehabilitation centers and their efforts to assist persons in recovery to lead more productive lives.
In 2021 the Tennessee Attorney General sued Food City over its opioid prescription numbers accusing the company of aiding and abetting unlawful oxycodone sales at three of its Knoxville pharmacies in Bearden West Hills and Hardin Valley in the middle of the opioid overdose epidemic. The allegations focused particularly on the Bearden store off Kingston Pike.
Among the accusations
Over a four-month period the store in Bearden bought more of a type of potent opioid pill than 38 states and the District of Columbia.
The Bearden store sold more of a type of opioid than any other retail pharmacy in the state from 2006-2014.
For a period of time the average prescription at the Bearden store was 267 opioid pills an average of nine pills per day for a 30-day prescription.
Between 2006 and 2014 the store bought 18 million Oxycodone pills which would be enough for every person in Knoxville to have 130 each.
The lawsuit came a couple of years after Tennessee's previous attorney general Herbert Slatery sued drugmaker AmerisourceBergen in 2019 over accusations it had unlawfully distributed more than 8.5 million oxycodone pills between 2006 and 2012 to the Bearden Food City location in Knoxville.
180 Health Partners wants to get pregnant addicted women into detox so babies will be healthier.
The company will work with TennCare's MCOs to identify women and connect them to resources.
The number of babies treated for NAS in 2014 is four times higher than in 2008.
It's attracted high profile boardmembers and investors as the state struggles with opioid addiction.
Melanie McCarter is about to start a job doing what she loves helping women find the right resources to get and stay clean so they can have a healthy life.
McCarter a mom of a 15-month-old son will start next month at 180 Health Partners  a new company focused on providing collaborative multidisciplinary care for pregnant women who are addicted to opioids that is attracting high-profile investors and board members.
Shell be a peer advocate someone who understands where the mom-to-be is at in life and help them get connected to the resources and motivation they need.
For McCarter it's a chance to be part of the support structure that people need  a peer who understands what it's like to be pregnant and addicted. She lost a baby at when she was nine months pregnant several years ago while fighting an opioid addiction.
Basically that Ive been where they are at and I came out of the other side clean McCarter said. I had family to push me in the right direction and not everyone has that.
Babies can be born drug dependent with a withdrawal syndrome called neonatal abstinence syndrome or NAS when they are exposed to opioids such as oxycodone or heroin while in the womb.
There were at least 1063 babies treated for NAS in Tennessee in 2014 because thats how many were treated by TennCare that year. Justin Lanning CEO of 180 Health expects the number is closer to 2000 to 2500.
Tennessee is dealing with a rising number of overdose deaths amid a struggle with opioid abuse and misuse that health officials dub an epidemic. Alongside the rising overdose death rate is an increase in the number of babies treated for NAS under TennCare. In 2008 the agency treated 264 newborns.
180 Health based in Brentwood will start working in January with some of the companies that administer TennCare to identify women who are at risk for having babies with NAS and getting them connected with either detox or tapering and other community resources.
180 Healths goal is to reduce the number of babies born dependent and help the women stay clean after giving birth so they and their family can have healthier lives.
Tennessee faces epidemic of drug-dependent babies
The company will work with obstetricians under TennCare to identify addicted women and assist them with getting into detox or tapering programs to get them off opioids before the baby is born. Dr. Mary Jane England a psychiatrist and professor at the Boston University School of Public Health said this could save the baby from undue harm.
Opioid use overtakes tobacco
We have science now that shows that detox and tapering programs are not harmful to the fetus said England a 180 Health board member. Dr. Craig Towers an obstetrician and professor at the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville did a five-year study on the effects of detox and is chairman of 180 Healths clinical advisory board.
The process is difficult but England said pregnancy is a moment to catch women when they are focused on the health of their baby.
If you ask a mom what shell do for her baby shell do a lot for her unborn baby England said.
The company will send people including peer advocates like McCarter social workers and nurse educators into the womens homes or accompany them to doctors visits. Transportation and missing work are often barriers to getting treatment or staying in recovery programs so 180 Health wants to fill in those gaps Lanning said.
It also will help the woman connect into resources in her community to ensure she has a recovery and support system as she adjusts to being a mom under the added pressure of staying clean. 180 Health will stay in touch with the woman for a year after she delivers.
Reducing the number of NAS babies and helping women get successfully into recovery carry financial and social benefits.
There are more opioid prescriptions than people in Tennessee
TennCare spent 48854 per NAS baby in 2014 versus 4951 for non-low birth weight babies. A baby born with NAS spent an average of 24 days in the hospital compared with two days for a healthy baby.
Even with the cost of treating a pregnant woman roughly 10000 to 12000 the early intervention is a less expensive option that has the potential to save treatment down the road Lanning said.
With a five-year 50 percent uptick in the number of people losing their parental rights due to addiction across the state it could help keep families together.
Tennessee parents lose kids as opioid crisis rages on
The company's mission and approach have attracted board members who have worked with Medicaid or managed-care organization entities in the past. Darin Gordon who left as TennCare's director in June for the private sector is chairman of the board.
Addressing opioid addiction and its ripple impacts at a time when women are already engaging with the health care system by bringing in behavioral health and community recovery resources will bring a holistic approach to treating addiction without stigma said Dr. Bill Frist an investor in 180 Health. Frist a former U.S. senator also backs Aspire Health which sends palliative care clinicians to people's homes.
The company plans to be working with 500 to 600 women by the end of the year and deepen its relationships with providers who may have been hesitant in the past to send women into treatment out of concern they would be prosecuted Lanning said. The company will get paid by the MCOs as it makes inroads in reducing the number of babies born with NAS.
We focus on a too often stigmatized frequently disenfranchised population who at a special time in their lives around the birth of their child today at best receive fragmented care that lacks continuity and chances of long-term success for mother and child Frist said. We are the first company in the opioid crisis to take to scale this comprehensive holistic dedicated approach to empowering moms with healthy babies.
McCarter's job officially starts Dec. 1 exactly a week before she celebrates being four years clean.
Opioid abuse has death grip on Tennessee
The cool thing is Im in on the ground level so Im getting to help them come up with different ideas and different ways to help women  whats going to be support or enabling she said. I have a passion for this. There are so many women  I just hope we can reach more people so they can get help. More healthy babies and more healthy women.

Overdose deaths in Tennessee jumped nearly 50 in 2020 according to new data from the Tennessee Department of Health. Close to 80 of overdose deaths were caused by synthetic and prescription opioids.
Tennesseans living with addiction point to two major factors in the spike in overdose deaths support systems interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the increased presence of fentanyl a highly potent synthetic opioid. These numbers put Tennessee on the leading edge of a rapidly progressing overdose crisis that claimed nearly 100000 lives in the United States in 2020.
COVID-19 restrictions and precautions have threatened some of the most relied-upon tools for managing addiction regular in-person meetings peer-to-peer support and the sense of connectedness that comes with a recovery community.
Nathan Payne lives in Cookeville Tennessee where he works for the Lifeline Peer Project a state-funded program staffed by individuals with personal experience managing addiction and recovery. When COVID first hit it was devastating to the whole recovery community not just to the new people remembers Payne. There were people with multiple years who are still not able to find their way back.
Healthcare workers and individuals managing substance abuse note that addiction thrives on loneliness. Payne compared individuals managing addiction with canaries in the coal mine highly sensitive to the larger trends in mental health exacerbated by a year of isolation. Per state prevalence data 436000 Tennesseans are living with a substance abuse disorder of some kind.
Part of maintaining recovery for folks who have struggled with addiction is that youve built up support around yourself said Amie Little a Peer Recovery Case Manager at the Sullivan County Anti-Drug Coalition in Bristol Tennessee an area of the state often overrepresented in opioid use and overdose data. Some people need a lot of structure rituals to go to meetingsa lot of support that people build around themselves. When COVID happened it wrecked a lot of them.
As rehabilitation centers and outreach programs have integrated COVID-19 safety precautions or deal with outbreaks typical rhythms for accepting referrals have become less predictable and less reliable. Timeliness predictability and reliability are crucial to addiction healthcare.
When someones ready to go to treatment you got to catch them right then. That clarity comes and goes. Working with folks in the jail we try to have them a bed and treatment for when theyre released said Little who works specifically with individuals returning from incarceration. COVID-19 policies and protocolsrequiring time for testing and quarantininghave extended and interrupted time-sensitive pathways to recovery. Ive had several clients die coming out of incarceration this year. Individuals returning from incarceration are far more likely than the general population to die of overdoses.
According to Little the continued criminalization of drug use has also contributed to the overdose crisis particularly as it relates to fentanyl. Of the 3032 overdose deaths that occurred last year 66 involved fentanyl. That is up from 18 in 2016 according to the most recent data from the Tennessee Department of Health.
Those who work closely in addiction healthcare like Payne and Little are aware of the increased presence of fentanylbad batches in Paynes words. Fentanyl is a highly potent synthetic opioid that can trigger an overdose in very small quantities. Its presence in methamphetamines cocaine and heroin can be a deliberate attempt to heighten narcotic effects or the accidental result of cross contamination.
Marie Williams Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services has overseen the States response to the opioid crisis since 2016.
We had a plan to deal with opioid abuse said Williams over the phone in late August. However as those came down street drugs laced with fentanyl came up. The reason were seeing a lot of overdoses right now is not what we were seeing five or eight years ago around the pill overdose its more the street drugs were seeing laced with fentanyl.
If fentanyl is present in a substance individuals often dont know beforehand and could face serious legal penalties for trying to find out. Test strips that allow users to determine the presence of fentanyl in street drugs are explicitly classified as drug paraphernalia under Tennessee law and carry potential felony charges. As jurisdictions around the country change punitive drug-testing laws Tennesseans still cant test street drugs for fentanyl without risking legal consequences.
There's been isolation with COVID yes but this population is historically cut off from community. People with substance abuse disorder - the person of low socioeconomic status who's smoking meth especially with criminal justice involvement are seen as drug addicts. Not community members. Making space for those people bringing them in enfranchising them giving them their community and standin back . . . that works.  Amie LIttle Sullivan County Anti-Drug Coalition
When overdoses do happen they do not have to be fatal. Naloxone also known by its brand name Narcan is an effective way to reverse an overdose if administered quickly. Since 2018 the State of Tennessee has distributed over 200000 Naloxone units that have been used to prevent an estimated 27000 overdose deaths per an internal report from August 2021. Narcan is effective but not always available and requires training for proper use. It can be found locally across Tennessee at the sites listed here.
If Narcan is not immediately on hand calling 911 for emergency medical assistance while witnessing an overdose could come with a second degree murder charge. Tennessees Death by Distribution law which went into effect in 2018 incriminates those involved in giving or selling someone drugs laced with fentanyl if that person fatally overdoses. The law was amended in 2019 to allow the state to pursue capital punishment.
Alongside its punitive laws Tennessees response to the opioid epidemic includes a vast network of intervention initiatives recovery resources and addiction healthcare workers like Nathan Payne. The Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services oversees an addiction services hotline 1-800-889-9789 administers Narcan and Narcan training and employs and supports peer recovery specialists statewide. Its 498-million-dollar budget is likely to swell in the coming years as attorneys general close in on billion-dollar settlements with opioid manufacturers and distributors.
Little who works independently from the State of Tennessee but for an employer that receives state funding emphasizes that it will take more than money to effectively address the forces that drive addiction jeopardize recovery and lead to more drug overdoses.
Theres been isolation with COVID yes but this population is historically cut off from community. People with substance abuse disorderthe person of low socioeconomic status whos smoking meth especially with criminal justice involvement are seen as drug addicts. Not community members said Little. Making space for those people bringing them in enfranchising them giving them their community and standing back and making a path forward for them. That works.
NASHVILLE Tenn.The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services TDMHSAS is excited to announce that applications are open for a new multi-million dollar behavioral health scholarship program.
The Tennessee Behavioral Health Pathways Scholarship is designed to support the next generation of professionals working in mental health and substance use treatment careers as they earn the advanced degrees necessary to begin their journey.
Eligible students can receive up to 15000 in tuition assistance per academic year for up to two years as they pursue a masters degree in fields including counseling psychiatric nursing social work psychology or similar behavioral health professions. In return for the tuition support students must commit to working for a public behavioral health provider for the same amount of time they were on scholarship.
Governor Bill Lee and the Tennessee General Assembly appropriated 3 million dollars for the scholarship program to the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services. TDMHSAS partnered with the Tennessee Association of Alcohol Drug and other Addiction Services TAADAS and the Tennessee Association of Mental Health Organizations TAMHO to administer the scholarship and ensure graduates meet their commitment for public service.
We know this work is so meaningful for the people who do it. The generation of young people thats in school now wants to help and with support from this scholarship theyll be able to embark on a fulfilling career in behavioral health without the burden of graduate school debt said TDMHSAS Commissioner Marie Williams LCSW. Were so grateful for our partners at TAMHO and TAADAS for their work on this program and were excited to see the impact that these amazing students will have on the people they serve.
TAADAS is honored to be a part of a program that creates a pipeline of new practitioners into the behavioral health workforce. In just a few weeks weve seen a surge in applications thanks to schools that are directing students to seek scholarships and TAADAS member agencies who are encouraging staff to apply as well. This is a win-win for students community agencies and the people of Tennessee who need behavioral health care said Mary Linden Salter Executive Director TAADAS.
TAMHO and its association members are so excited to support this scholarship initiative and are grateful to the next generation of behavioral health professionals who are committing to serve the people of Tennessee. Governor Bill Lee the Tennessee General Assembly TDMHSAS and TennCare have done incredible work to address public behavioral health workforce issues in the near term through rate increases and retention bonuses.

Tennessee's regional overdose prevention specialists distribute these kits to people who live and work among illicit drug use. Each box of Narcan includes two doses but often two or more doses are required.
Public health officials are encouraging more Tennessee residents to carry the overdose reversal drug naloxone because of a sharp rise in drug deaths. But acquiring doses of the pricey Narcan nasal spray takes some maneuvering.
Andrea Hancock a regional overdose prevention specialist funded by the state spends most of her days training people to use Narcan and distributing two-dose kits  but only to those who need it most.
Naloxone is one of those things youd rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it Hancock says. You never know when youll come across an opioid overdose.
She says her own sons life was spared by Narcan last year. He overdosed after using cocaine laced with fentanyl which is increasingly common and helped lead to another record year of fatal overdoses in 2021.
The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services has distributed 300000 two-dose boxes since October 2017 with 44000 confirmed lives saved according to the agency. Especially with potent fentanyl overdose reversal often requires two doses or more.
The spike in fentanyl-laced drugs has put more demands on the supply. The state uses mostly federal grant money to buy Narcan at 67.50 per unit. The vials of naloxone which require the use of a syringe cost just 3 a piece for the state and are not as widely used.
For those who are regularly around illicit drug use
Regional overdose prevention specialists known as ROPS listed here are the best points of contact. They will come and provide a brief training and  if needed  provide Narcan doses. On Thursday the Main Library in Nashville is hosting a one-hour training at 11 a.m. and offering overdose kits while supplies last. Call 615 862-5815 to register. STARS Nashville will offer more trainings at a community celebration June 11 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at 1704 Charlotte Ave.
Streetworks which runs a needle exchange program also distributes Narcan from both its mobile truck contact here and at its office at 1326B Rosa Parks Blvd in Nashville.
Low-income clinics such as Neighborhood Health will sometimes have Narcan available to hand out though not always.
For those who just want to be prepared
There is a standing order at Tennessee pharmacies which means Narcan is available without a prescription. But its likely not free. Private insurance can cover with a co-pay I just ordered some generic Narcan while writing this paragraph from a Walmart pharmacy with a 10 co-pay though the pharmacist said most insurance limits to one box per month. Starting in July all opioid prescriptions should come with an offer of naloxone under a new state law.
The cost out of pocket can run as high as 150. But Hancock recommends using GoodRx which acts essentially like a coupon and brings the cost down to between 30 and 50.
It can happen to the first-time users. It can happen to experimenters. It can happen to a toddler who accidentally gets into their caretakers medication Hancock says. Weve heard all kinds of stories so we make sure the individuals have access to naloxone in order to save a life.
Rachel Blado rolled out of bed at 432 a.m. and sank into a chair outside her bedroom to read her Bible. Her unassuming home in the Nashville suburbs should have been quiet at this hour but a faint chatter echoed from downstairs. Someone had left a television on overnight.
Blado a mother of three in her late 30s shuffled down the steps into her living room then followed the noise to the basement which a year ago had been converted into a bedroom for her 20-year-old son Josh Holton. Through the door she could hear her son's TV streaming TED Talks which he watched every night before bed.
Blado peeked inside. Holton was sitting awkwardly on his couch slumped forward and to the side like he had fallen asleep while reaching to touch his toes. Blado stepped into the room to rouse her son calling his name and shaking his shoulder. His skin was cold.
Suddenly Holtons head rolled to the side revealing thick mucus draining out of his nose and mouth.
Then I heard this horrible horrible noise  a deep hideous wailing  and I realized it was me Blado said describing the moment she found her son. I ran out of the room tried to make it back up the stairs but collapsed. My husband came down and I just screamed Hes gone. Hes gone. 
Soon the house in the suburbs was busy. Paramedics rushed into the basement bedroom then determined that Holton was long gone killed by some sort of drug overdose in the middle of the night. They summoned a detective from the Metro Nashville Police Department who cordoned off the basement and began to search for clues. On Holtons table he found pills crushed into a line of blue-gray powder and a straw made from a tightly rolled 20 bill.
Meanwhile Blado got on the phone and roused three of Holtons closest friends all of whom had known him since childhood who hurried to the house as the sun rose. Blado met them at the door hugged them tight and pointed toward Holtons room.
Go in and see him Blado said. This is what drugs do.
The three young men stood in a doorway and peered inside. Belongings were splayed across their friend's messy room remnants of a life cut short  a dresser full of books dangling boxing gloves and a cluster of artsy photos pinned unceremoniously to the wall. Holton was still on the couch.
The police detective turned to the young men in the doorway speaking matter-of-factly as if he had been here a thousand times before.
Do you know what he might have taken the detective asked.
They did. Or at least they thought they did.
One of the friends answered.
Xanax.
OPIOIDS1 family 3 deaths Couple must pick up pieces  again  after overdoses
MOREThis pain clinic nurse gave a patient 51 pills a day. And she kept her license.
A fake pill  A deadly lie
No one knows exactly how Josh Holton died but it is clear he wasnt killed by Xanax.
His body was found a little more than two years ago in the early morning hours of Sept. 15 2016 at his parents home in southeast Nashville. Police closed all investigations into the death earlier this year and deemed it an accidental overdose involving no prosecutable crime.
But in a state that has been ravaged by the opioid epidemic recording more than 7000 casualties in five years Holtons death was something different. He was not a surgery patient who became addicted to painkillers after being prescribed too many for too long. Nor was he a heroin addict who died while scouring the streets for the biggest high of his life. And he didnt overdose on meth or cocaine or a deadly combo of opioids and benzodiazepines all of which kill hundreds of people in Tennessee each year.
Instead based on multiple interviews and a review of police documents personal text messages and emails it appears that Holton fell victim to the little-known threat of counterfeit medication which experts say is thriving in the anonymous and unregulated corners of the internet. Holton who was quietly mourning the death of his biological father bought Xanax a sedative often used to treat anxiety on the darknet to help himself cope. Instead Holton received pills containing only fentanyl an opioid 50 times stronger than heroin.
Much of the research into Holton's death was done by Blado herself who spent months probing her son's computer and squeezing answers out of his friends some of whom were too scared to speak with police. For this story she shared much of her research with The Tennessean in an effort to spotlight the danger of counterfeit pills.
I think Josh was self-medicating but not explaining to his friends what was really going on Blado said. He was inexperienced and he found something he didnt know was dangerous. And it killed him.
Counterfeit pills have been found in 45 states and caused deaths in 27  including as many as three others in Middle Tennessee  according to the Partnership for Safe Medicines a California nonprofit that studies the issue.
This death toll is also certainly undercounted because overdoses from fake medications are notoriously hard to confirm at least in part because the victim is often the only person with knowledge of what drug they intended to take.
Regardless the cases that are confirmed span everything from fake painkillers to fake cancer drugs said Shabbir Safdar executive director of the nonprofit. Many victims look exactly like Holton young men who try to buy Xanax online but instead receive fake pills made with black-market pill presses and cheap fentanyl imported from China or Mexico.
For all practical purposes this is happening throughout the entire country right now Safdar said. If youve got an interstate these pills are most certainly in your state.
'He could never have too much knowledge'
Holton was born in southern Maryland but came to Nashville in middle school as his mother and stepfather moved to Tennessee in search of jobs during the 2008 recession. As a teen he attended Lighthouse Christian School in Antioch then graduated through home schooling and enrolled at Middle Tennessee State University. At the time of his death Holton was attending classes at Nashville State Community College and working full time at the Nissan plant in Smyrna. In his free time Holton was an avid photographer who dreamed of one day transforming his hobby into a small business.
Despite this busy life in Nashville Holton remained close with his biological father Doug Brown Jr. a self-made Maryland restaurateur whom he often visited over the summer. Brown and his brother Daniel with whom Holton was also close drowned in the Chesapeake Bay in 2015.
Friends and family say Holton never recovered from the death of his father and uncle and his mourning worsened symptoms of insomnia that had plagued him for years. Sadness and exhaustion put a subtle damper on a young man who was otherwise ponderous inquisitive and relentlessly ambitious.
In addition to photography Holton dreamed of following in the footsteps of his entrepreneurial father and showed interest in real estate graphic design and the stock market. On the day he died he was scheduled to attend a class on advanced Microsoft Excel which he hoped would help get him a promotion at the Nissan plant.
He was always learning and I dont think he was capable of having a surface conversation said Trinity Thompson 22 who was Holton's friend since middle school. He could never have too much knowledge and he would ask why about everything until you were having this deep conversation and you didnt even know how you got there.
This same inquisitiveness is likely why Holton was so enamored by TED Talks an online series of eclectic speeches that have become widely popular in the digital age. Thousands of TED Talks have been posted since the platform went online in the mid-2000s and presenters include scientists philosophers religious leaders and former presidents.
Holton watched these talks nightly when he got home from his late shift at the Nissan plant his mother said. And it was from one of these talks she says that Holton first learned how to buy narcotics online.
In the year before he died Holton watched a 2015 TED Talk by Jamie Bartlett a journalist who had recently published a book on the darknet a portion of the internet that can be accessed only through anonymous browsers.
In the 14-minute speech Bartlett focuses heavily on how illegal drugs can be bought secretly and anonymously online and at times describes the online marketplace as an achievement of innovation capitalism and customer service. The author stresses that he is not promoting drug use but he also says at one point that buying drugs on the darknet is a reasonably good way of guaranteeing a certain level of purity.
Many of you here will be on the darknet fairly soon. Not that Im suggesting anyone in this audience would use it to go and procure high-quality narcotics Bartlett said pausing as the audience laughed.
Blado said one of her son's friends told her this TED Talk is what originally gave Holton the idea to buy drugs online. She watched it for the first time in the months after he died.
Every time the audience laughed she said it just hit me in my gut.
Holtons friend declined to be interviewed by The Tennessean but confirmed that he and Holton bought the pills online after Holton got the idea from the TED Talk. The friend denied any involvement when speaking to law enforcement police records show.
Bartlett did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this article. A TED Talks spokesperson refused an interview but issued a statement saying that Bartletts speech explained how the darknet worked at the time and that neither this talk nor TED condone the purchase of illegal or non-prescribed drugs on the darknet.
'It looked just like any other Xanax'
As far as his family knows Holton bought drugs off the darknet only twice.
The first time was in August 2016 about a month before his death when he and his friend ordered Xanax off AlphaBay an anonymous marketplace that has since been shut down by the federal government. It is believed that the first shipment was really Xanax and Holton took the pills without issue.
But then in September Holton and his friend ordered again.
Holton's family found out what the pills really were about two months later. Officials emailed Blado a copy of her sons autopsy report showing authorities tested his blood for more than 75 drugs but found just fentanyl. The blue-gray powder on his desk also tested positive for fentanyl  and only fentanyl  records show.
Now burdened with the truth Blado knew she had to warn the others. On Thanksgiving as her son's friends gathered in her home to play board games in the basement Blado pulled out a copy of the autopsy report and asked them to read it.
Some ran out the door and fell on the ground. Others just stood there. Others sat on the couch crying Blado said. I realized then that they really really really didnt know about counterfeit medications.
The reveal was especially thunderous for Chris Brown one of Holton's closest friends who was also one of the few people to see the darknet pills before Holton died.
In an interview with the Tennessean Brown said Holton confided in him that he was buying Xanax online and taking the pills before bed. Brown was worried about his friend but kept his concerns to himself.
Later Holton offered Brown one of the pills and Brown reluctantly accepted. It was marked with a trademark Xanax stamp just like medication he had gotten from a pharmacist before. Brown said the pill put him into a deep sleep but left him unharmed.
To this day Brown does not know for certain if he took a real pill or a fake one.
Thats the most haunting thing  it looked just like any other Xanax Brown said. This could have happened to any of us.

A high school student in Tennessee was charged with murder after two teenagers were found dead of a suspected drug overdose at their rural Tennessee school this week.
Authorities said Thursday afternoon that the student facing charges was also hospitalized in critical condition during the incident at Fayette-Ware High School in Somerville a town of less than 3500 people about 50 miles northeast of Memphis.
Fayette County District Attorney Mark Davidson confirmed that the girl who has been charged is facing two counts of second-degree murder and one count of possession of a controlled substance. All charges have been filed in juvenile court according to the Memphis Commercial Appeal part of the USA TODAY Network..
All three teens one 16 years old and the others age 17 were completing their junior year at the high school Fayette County Public Schools released in a statement on Wednesday.
The school reported the students were outside the school during the incident though it did not specify where.
Just before school's graduation
The sheriff's office told local outlet WRGE Memphis they were notified about the incident at 440 p.m. just hours before the school's graduation took place.
Chief Deputy Ray Garcia told the outlet officers responded to the school for a report of two people that appeared to not be breathing.
The teen who survived was upgraded to stable condition.

NASHVILLE Tenn. Spring cleaning season is here and people across Tennessee are preparing to clean out their medicine cabinets and safely and securely dispose of medications that are expired or no longer needed during National Prescription Drug Take Back Day. Take Back Day is this Saturday April 30 from 1000 a.m. to 200 p.m. local time.
During the October 2021 Take Back Day Tennesseans safely and securely disposed of nearly 17000 pounds of medications at 112 sites across the state. In the decade that the Drug Enforcement Agency has organized Take Back Day Tennesseans have safely and securely disposed of more than 330000 pounds of medications.
Find a Take Back Day event or permanent prescription drop box at this link
The bi-annual medication collection event comes as authorities from the DEA to the TBI are warning of the danger of counterfeit prescription pills that are laced with fentanyl. The DEA estimates that four out of every 10 counterfeit pills bought on the street or over the internet or social media apps contain a lethal dose of fentanyl.
Thats having deadly consequences across the country but the effects are most strongly felt among young adults and teens. Overdose deaths among American teens nearly doubled from 2019 to 2020 and researchers estimate the 2021 numbers will show another 20 increase in overdose deaths. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show fentanyl overdose deaths among teens increased by nearly 170 in just one year.
Safely disposing of unwanted pharmaceuticals at drop-off locations across the state helps ensure medicines are not misused or accidentally taken by someone they were unintended for.
Roughly 50 Nashville bars restaurants and businesses are getting Narcan nasal spray which is a medicine that reverses the effects of a drug overdose.
This is all thanks to a local non-profit and security group teaming up to help save lives.
The opioid crisis is a national epidemic and unfortunately overdoses are on the rise here in Nashville. I was narcanned seven times overdose survivor Rich Johnston said. Johnston says he was addicted to heroin and calls Narcan a miracle drug. I would 100 not be here if it were not for Narcan Johnston emphasized.
Jack Byrd says his teams at Solaren Risk Management a private security group who works with more than 100 downtown businesses partnered with TEMPO which is Gibson's program to offer opioid emergency response kits.
One of the bars receiving these Narcan kits is Dierks Bentleys Whiskey Row on Broadway. Its just like an AED that when you open it up it will start playing a video that tells you how to properly put on PPE to make sure youre safe and everyone else is safe Byrd explained. Byrd says these kits will go up right next to the bars' AEDs.
He says this kit gives step-by-step instruction on how to administer Narcan so this way if someone has training or not they act and respond immediately.
Seconds matter. Absolutely and when you encounter someone experiencing that kind of crisis Byrd said.
Unfortunately its a crisis that Nashvilles bars and restaurants are seeing more of every month.
As a management company on Lower Broadway we have a very close relationship with Metro Nashville Police Department and we know whats going on in Nashville so being a part of this program is our way to help prevent and educate people on this crisis and what we can do to help stop it Lissa Druss with RIOT Hospitality Group said.
This initiative will hopefully help stop people from dying.
I work as an interventionist now and its something that cannot be replaced and the importance of which cannot be overstated Johnston emphasized.
Byrd says by Friday thirty of the downtown bars and restaurants will have these Narcan kits installed right next to their AED and then they will begin the next phase.
Area experts gathered in Portland for a panel discussion on the local opioid crisis Thursday.
Members of the community were told about the problems frontline workers face and solutions and resources available to the public.
More Sumner Cheatham coalitions focus on opioid crisis at town hall
More Sumner County participates in Drug Take Back Day prevention awareness
The panel was comprised of 10 people many of whom were involved in local government and local law enforcement from Robertson and Sumner Counties.
Portland Mayor Mike Callis moderated the evenings discussion.
There are very few families that have not been touched by this if its not overdose death its a child that youve seen absolutely just be torn from you because their entire personality has been stolen by the love of the drug State Representative and event panelist William Lamberth said.
In 2019 in the state of Tennessee we had 2089 confirmed overdose deaths 2089 people just gone from us because of this he said. In 2020 that number was up to 3091  thats 1000 more deaths in one year.
Now when you have that kind of increase in one year thats why were all here. Weve all got to focus on this. No one person has all the answers to it but surely collectively we can get that number headed back down the other direction and hopefully get it back down to zero.
A growing crisis
Sumner County Sheriffs Office Major and panelist Tim Bailey illustrated the county's growing crisis by showing the increase in case files the Sheriff's Office handles - a few pages encompassed all of 2015's overdose reports.
A folder contains 2021's overdose reports from January-June.
In 2015 Sumner County had 9 total overdoses one involving fentanyl. In 2019 we had 27 overdoses 21 involving fentanyl. In 2020 we had 35 overdoses 33 with fentanyl and in 2021 so far year-to-date we've had 17 overdoses 16 involving fentanyl he said.
Since 2018 Sumner County Sheriff's Office officers have deployed Narcan a remedy for opioid overdose in the field more than 100 times Bailey added.
We have successfully prosecuted less than a dozen cases where we can find the dealer and charge him with second degree murder he said. We're trying hard to identify these dealers that are dealing this poison but it's not easy.
Other panel officials agreed.
We're doing everything we can as you can see to attack the problem from a lot of different areas District Attorney General Ray Whitley said.
Problems persist
The state's rate of opioid prescriptions available funding manpower and other issues frontline workers face all contribute to the opioid crisis.
The Tennessee Department of Health Drug Overdose Dashboard provides several state-wide statistics on overdose deaths further illustrating the extent of the problem.
In 2018 Tennessee providers wrote 81.8 opioid prescriptions for every 100 people ranking as the third-highest prescribing rate in the country and more than the average U.S. rate of 51.4 prescriptions according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
In 2019 there were 47 drug overdose deaths in Sumner County and 506 nonfatal overdose outpatient visits.
Many in law enforcement say Fentanyl is the biggest contributing factor to the opioid crisis.
Between 2013 and 2017 alone deaths from fentanyl in Tennessee increased by 800 according to the tndagc.org public education campaign - Fentanyl The Deadliest High.
Fentanyl is about everything we see now and touch 18th Judicial District Drug Task Force Director Kelly Murphy said.
They say one kilo of fentanyl has the possibility to kill up to 100000 people just in Sumner County alone. Just in our agency off two cases last year we took in a quarter kilo total of fentanyl so you're looking at the possibility of 125000 people's lives being affected if that hits the streets he said.
I don't think we've ever worked anything as powerful as this that affects as many people.
Thinking about solutions
Interagency cooperation makes up one aspect in the fight against the opioid crisis.
Of all the crimes that we investigate with the exception of child sex abuse I would say that overdoses and overdose deaths probably result in more interagency cooperation than any other crime that we work Portland Chief of Police Jason Williams said.
But cooperation from the public is important too.
It's probably just as important if not more important than cooperation amongst ourselves because these people who are dying out here in the community nine times out of ten we show up and they're strangers to us Williams said.
Without the help of family members friends and neighbors officers don't get very far he noted.
If we have an overdose where someone doesn't die a lot of times we can't get any cooperation from that person because they're just not ready to turn the corner yet and that's frustrating he said.
That's another area where family could possibly help because family support and having a support system in place is the most important thing for somebody to be able to turn the corner and lay down that drug.
But officials don't always know where to look making reporting an important piece of the puzzle.
Policy change takes time
Lobbying for legislation and voting elected officials into office that support the cause can spur major local impact.
And the state government is examining the issue.
House Bill 1132 or the opioid abatement bill was adopted and passed on May 4.
The bill sponsored by Senator Ferrell Haile enacts the Tennessee Opioid Abatement Act fund authorizing the attorney general and reporter to settle claims against opioid manufacturers.
Haile was on hand Thursday to serve on the panel and talk about the bill which outlines how funds received from settlement agreements will be allocated.

A look at the stats
Drug overdose in Tennessee
5029476 opioid painkiller prescriptions in 2020
16670 nonfatal overdose outpatient visits in 2019
7240 nonfatal overdose inpatient stays in 2019
2089 all drug overdose deaths in 2019
Over the past two years rural Greene County in northeastern Tennessee has collected more than 2.7 million from regional and national settlements with opioid manufacturers and distributors. But instead of helping people harmed by addiction county officials are finding other ways to spend it.
They have put 2.4 million toward paying off the countys debt and have directed another 1 million arriving over more than a decade into a capital projects fund. In March they appropriated 50000 from that fund to buy a litter crew vehicle  a pickup truck to drive inmates to collect trash along county roads.
Its astounding said Nancy Schneck a retired nurse who has seen addiction infiltrate the community where employers avoid drug testing for fear of losing too many employees and mental health crises and homelessness are rampant. She wants to see the money go toward mental health and addiction treatment. Why cant county leaders see treating some people and maybe getting them out of this cycle might be advantageous she said.
In 2021 the latest year for which comparable data is available Greene Countys rate of drug overdose deaths topped state and national figures.
But Mayor Kevin Morrison said the county has borne the costs of the opioid epidemic for years It has funded a beleaguered sheriffs office improved the jail  which is packed with people whove committed addiction-related crimes  and supported a drug court to divert some people to treatment. It has also suffered indirect costs of the crisis people dropping out of the workforce due to addiction schools and welfare services caring for more children whove experienced trauma and some taxpayers leaving the county altogether. Addiction is not the sole reason for Greene Countys economic woes but it has contributed to more than 30 million of debt.
Weve been dealing with this crisis for quite some time but nobody wants to pay the bill as it comes Morrison said. So when these funds are made available then we are paying bills that have been due for quite some time.
The debate in this Appalachian county is reverberating nationwide as state and local governments receive billions of dollars from companies that made distributed or sold opioid painkillers like Johnson  Johnson Cardinal Health and CVS. The companies were accused of fueling the overdose epidemic and the money is meant to remediate that harm. About 3 billion has already landed in state county and city coffers and about 50 billion more is expected in the coming decade and beyond.
States are required to spend at least 85 of the money on opioid-related programs but KFF Health News ongoing investigation into how the cash is used  and misused  shows there is wide interpretation of that standard and little oversight.
That restriction didnt apply to the money Greene County moved to its capital projects fund.
In many rural communities which have been struggling to pay addiction-related costs for decades local officials justify using the settlement funds to reimburse past expenses. Most of Tennessees 95 counties are in significant debt which can present difficult choices about how to use this money said Robert Pack co-director of East Tennessee State Universitys Addiction Science Center.
Still he and many advocates hope the settlement funds are spent on tackling the current crisis. After all more than 200 people nationwide are dying of overdoses each day. Investing in treatment and prevention can save lives and protect future generations they say.
There is no good excuse to sit on the funds or put them into a general fund said Tricia Christensen policy director for the nonprofit Community Education Group. The organization is tracking settlement spending across Appalachia which Christensen called the epidemics ground zero. These dollars should be used to support people who have been most impacted by the overdose crisis.
Nationally there has been little oversight of the settlement dollars. President Joe Bidens administration pledged to ensure the funds went toward tackling the addiction crisis but has taken little action. Accountability at the state level varies.
In Tennessee 15 of the states opioid settlement funds are controlled by the legislature and another 15 by local governments. Those two buckets have few restrictions.
The other 70 is controlled by an Opioid Abatement Council which has more rigorous standards. When the council which must give 35 of its funds to local governments recently distributed more than 31 million to counties it required the funds be spent on a list of approved interventions such as building recovery housing and increasing addiction treatment for uninsured people.
I can guarantee were going to bird-dog those funds said Stephen Loyd chair of the council and a physician in recovery from opioid addiction. If counties use them for unapproved purposes the counties will not receive future payouts he said.
Greene Countys reimbursement of its capital projects fund comes from its own pot  the 15 that is controlled entirely by local governments.
In such cases the public can hold officials accountable Loyd said. If you dont like the way the money is being spent you have the ability to vote.
Local leaders are generally not being nefarious with these decisions he said. They make hundreds of budgetary choices a month and simply dont have experience with addiction or health policy to guide them in using the money.
Loyd and other local experts are trying to fill that gap. He meets with county officials and recommends they speak with their local anti-drug coalitions or hold listening sessions to hear from community members. Pack from East Tennessee State urges them to increase access to medications that have proven effective in treating opioid addiction.
Both men point counties to an online recovery ecosystem index where leaders can see how their areas resources for recovery compare with those of others.
In Greene County for example the index indicates there are no recovery residences and the number of treatment facilities and mental health providers per 100000 residents is below state and national averages.
Thats a great place to get started Loyd said.
Some Greene County residents want to see opioid settlement funds go to local initiatives that are already operating on the ground. The Greene County Anti-Drug Coalition for instance hosts presentations to educate young people and their parents on the risks of drug use. They meet with convenience store owners to reinforce the importance of not selling alcohol cigarettes or vaping devices to minors. In the future the coalition hopes to offer classes on life skills such as how to budget and make decisions under pressure.
If we can do prevention work with kids we can change the trajectory of their lives as adults said Wendy Peay secretary of the anti-drug coalition and executive director of United Way of Greene County.
The coalition has asked the county for settlement funds but has not received any yet.
Nearby in Carter County a new residential treatment facility is taking shape at the site of a former prison. At least seven counties cities and towns in the region have committed a combined 10 million in opioid settlement funds to support it said Stacy Street a criminal court judge who came up with the idea. Greene County is among the few local governments that did not contribute.
It will be part of the regions drug recovery court system in which people with addiction who have committed crimes are diverted to intensive treatment instead of prison.
Currently there are no long-term residential facilities in the area for such patients Street said. Too often people in his court receive treatment during the day but return home at night to the same sandbox playing with the same sand-mates increasing their risk of relapse.
Street said the new facility will not offer medications to treat opioid addiction  the gold standard of medical care  because of security concerns. But some patients may be taken to receive them off campus.
Morrison the Greene County mayor said he worried about contributing to the facility because it is a recurring cost and the settlement funds will stop flowing in 2038.
Theres been great pressure put on local entities like Greene County to try to solve this problem with this limited amount of funding he said when the federal government which has the ability to print money to solve these problems is not in this business.
The county is still deciding how to spend nearly 334000 of settlement funds it recently received from the states Opioid Abatement Council. Morrison said theyre considering using it for the anti-drug coalitions education efforts and the county drug court. Given the guidelines from the abatement council these funds cant be used to pay old debts.

Tennessee hospitals have seen a quick resurgence in COVID cases since hitting a low point July 4.
Listen
Tennessee health officials say the state is beyond the opioid crisis and not in a good way. Theyre expanding their sights to include many more deadly drugs by calling it  broadly  an overdose crisis.
Fatal overdoses continue to climb in Tennessee and most still involve opioids. But its no longer conventional prescription painkillers directly to blame. Its illicit fentanyl often made in a clandestine lab. And increasingly victims also have either cocaine or meth in their system according to data from the Metro Health Department.
Nashville opioid response coordinator Trevor Henderson says the drug combinations reflect a larger concern.
We sort of have an addictive society he says. If that indeed is true and addiction is the underlying problem we cant focus on just one substance. We have to be broader than that.
More How Drug Combos Are Making Tennessees Opioid Problem Even More Deadly
If focused solely on opioids health officials might miss all the new instances of weekend drug users who end up overdosing because their cocaine was laced with powerful fentanyl says Henderson who reviews each overdose fatality in Davidson County.
Nationally researchers say there are as many as four separate drug epidemics occurring simultaneously with regional variations around the country.
Starting in January 2020 Tennessee is changing how it categorizes overdoses in the hospital. No longer will the reportable condition be opioid drug overdose but rather drug overdose as to include stimulants like meth and cocaine benzodiazepines and muscle relaxers.
NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  Its the epidemic you may have heard little about in 2020 but we now know drug overdoses claimed more than 93000 lives that year.
The Centers for Disease Control says this increase of nearly 30 percent from the year before is the highest number of deaths in twelve months. Its also the largest increase since 1999.
Trevor Henderson is the director of Metro Nashvilles Overdose Response Program. He says it wasnt long ago that 300 deaths across Davidson County were cause for alarm.
Last year alone that number more than doubled with 619 people who lost their lives to overdose in Davidson County. Henderson says its important to note that this number is not limited to residents of Davidson County. There are some cases where individuals are transported to the county from another hospital in the state and die.
Suspected Fatal Drug Overdoses
Nashville saw a 32 increase in fatal drug overdoses in 2020 compared to the year prior with 468 suspected drug overdose deaths in 2019 and 619 in 2020. So far this year there have been 360 fatal overdoses up 11 compared to the same time last year.
Last year 80 of overdose-related toxicology reports detected fentanyl.
In 2020 the highest number of deaths occurred in the following ZIP codes 37207 37115 37211 37013 37209
The ZIP codes with the largest increase in deaths compared to 2019 are 37209 up 167 37210 up 156 and 37217 up 83.
Nonfatal Drug Overdose-related Emergency Department Visits
Visits were up 30 in 2020 compared to 2019.
In 2019 more than half of these visits 57 involved heroin but in 2020 50 involved opioids without heroin and 45 involved heroin.
In 2020 the highest number of drug overdoses requiring EMS response occurred in the following ZIP codes 37115 37211 37013 37214
The ZIP codes with the largest increase in overdose incidents compared to 2019 are 37214 up 85 37076 up 57 and 37210 up 57.
Henderson says at this rate we could top 700 for the first time in the county and its an issue he says is only made worse because of fentanyl.
When you ask whats my concern. I think thats pretty obvious. This crisis has become much more deadly Henderson said.
The synthetic opioid can be found in virtually any drug and it doesnt help that its one of the deadliest when abused. Henderson says for Tennessee to make any progress we have to think of this as a public health crisis.
Its like a lot of other chronic health care conditions. A system of care needs to be built. We have a lot of the pieces but its not a system that is seamless just yet Henderson said.
Henderson says ideally we should see Narcan kits offered to overdose survivors as they leave the hospital. That way they have a life-saving tool already available. He says work is already underway to make this a reality at local emergency rooms.
Tennessee has not released its numbers for 2020 overdose deaths but the CDC already predicts an increase of more than 40 percent from 2019. Only nine other states had predictions that high according to their data. In 2019 Tennessee had 2089 overdose deaths. None of these numbers surprise Tanja Jacobs.
It just shows that this is worse than most people think Jacobs said.
Her son Romello Marchman died of an overdose in 2020 but Jacobs calls it fentanyl poisoning. Her son ingested what he thought was cocaine only for a medical examiner to discover it was laced with fentanyl. She says no one intends on taking this highly potent drug so its poisoning at the very least. Murder at it's most extreme.
All you can do is tell people how dangerous it is and for people not to get complacent and think that their kids dont do it Jacobs said.
Through the Romello Marchman Foundation Jacobs has advocated for distributing fentanyl test strips as a life-saving measure. These strips have proven to help detect some trace amounts of fentanyl in most drugs. Jacobs says shes coordinating with national distributors to bring more of these strips to Davidson County.
Under current Tennessee law fentanyl test strips could be considered drug paraphernalia. Henderson says his office is working with Davidson County DA Glenn Funks office to decriminalize the distribution of these strips.
Jacobs understands these may be long-term solutions but she says we can begin with a public service announcement just as we did with COVID-19. With the number of overdose deaths continuing to rise she says it only makes sense to share whats at stake if we cant find a solution.
Were looking at shocking numbers now. Were projecting more shocking numbers for this year. Next year who knows where well be Henderson said.
In hindsight all the odd events added up.
The missing soda bottle caps and the vanishing spoons from the kitchen drawer. The hollow excuses and the irresponsible decisions.
How Heather Baltz would sleep through her infant son's cries and return to the tidy brick ranch-style home that she shared with her parents and two children in Donelson hours after her waitress shift ended. I had to help a friend Mom she would tell Tina Baltz.
And the money. Their once responsible daughter was suddenly always short of cash asking her dad for 50 or 100 to pay her phone bill or to get to the next paycheck.
I was a sucker said her father Mickey Baltz. I wasn't paying for her phone bill. I was paying for drugs.
I believe people when they tell me something. 'Course with her I believed it for way too long.
Heather Baltz died Feb. 23 during the reporting of this story of a heart infection doctors believe originated with a contaminated needle used to shoot heroin. She had turned to heroin after running out of pain pills prescribed for gallbladder surgery in 2014.
She was 28 and by then the Baltzes were long past denial.
For years the epicenter of the state's opioid crisis has been northeast Tennessee devastating small towns and rural communities that dot the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.
The state has the dubious distinction of having the second highest rate of opioid prescriptions in the nation.
In the past four years however the drug epidemic has crept steadily westward morphing into a heroin-driven public health crisis as opioid prescriptions became more closely regulated. People addicted to opioids turn to heroin a cheaper and more readily available opioid when medications such as oxycodone got harder to come by. They also turn to fentanyl a powerful opioid that can be cheaply manufactured in illegal labs and often proves fatal in small amounts.
Between 2014 and 2016 Nashville's drug overdose rates jumped by more than 71 percent a sudden spike that has left city health officials emergency responders and a porous safety net of treatment providers scrambling to catch up.
The city's drug overdose rates have now reached and in some instances surpassed rates in rural Appalachia according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Heather Baltz's death marked the family's most brutal encounter with Nashville's opioid and heroin crisis.
But it was not the only one.
In 2013 they were awakened by a 3 a.m. knock on the door. A Metro police chaplain informed them that Tina Baltz's brother 47-year-old Paul Shoulders Jr. had been killed in a car accident.
Shoulders was driving on Interstate 40 near Hermitage when his pickup was clipped by Robert Todd Harrell a former bassist for the band 3 Doors Down. Harrell was later convicted of vehicular homicide.
Todd Harrell case Ex-3 Doors Down bassist gets prison in deadly crash
He was speeding at 101 mph with the opioid oxycodone and the muscle relaxant alprazolam in his system. Last week Harrell was arrested again in Mississippi on unrelated drug gun and domestic violence charges and faces a revocation of his probation in Shoulders' death.
Then in 2016 a police chaplain came knocking again. This time it was to report the death of Heather's former boyfriend Ralph Hardin who lived with the Baltzes and was helping to raise the two children he and Heather shared together.
Hardin 29 was fatally shot with his own gun in a room at the Red Roof Inn where  the Baltzes say  he had gone to confront Heather's dealer. Police closed the case concluding Hardin may have accidentally shot himself.
Two days before his death Hardin had posted pictures of heroin paraphernalia on his Facebook page promising he would track down whoever had supplied drugs to Heather.
It was during Harrell's trial and its aftermath in late 2015 that the Baltzes confronted their daughter.
She said it was pills Tina Baltz said. We told her she needed to get help. She was scared to death. She was worried about what would happen to the kids and losing custody.
One day while the family attended Harrell's trial Heather leaned over to her mother and whispered that she had bought drugs from the same dealer who had supplied the man who killed her uncle.
For the next two years Heather was in and out of jail for stealing followed by three brief stints in rehab. Her parents kicked her out then welcomed her back in loaned her a car then demanded it back.
They formally took custody of the two children Heather left behind Braelyn 8 and Tyler 4 after Hardin's death. Heather agreed to the custody change.
Heather was high when she signed the papers Mickey Baltz said.
While Mickey Baltz who is 58 and his wife 50 were raising Heather's children they also were visiting pawn shops to buy back the jewelry the power washer and the iPad Heather sold to buy drugs. Her father was cruising neighborhoods where he thought Heather may be living.
Married for 29 years the couple also held down full-time jobs. Mickey Baltz works as an auto body technician. His wife works as an administrative assistant for an insurance company.
Tina Baltz said she felt like she was watching the brown-haired hazel-eyed sweet girl she raised simply disappear.
The whole time I was thinking will she ever be the same person again she said. And I didn't think so and she wasn't.
You see shows like 'Intervention' and we've watched them for years even before anything with Heather. And everyone starts out saying they were a happy child or a happy baby and then they go into the bad stuff. Then you think why was everyone who was a happy child go into that problem.
She was shy and she was a happy child. And then this happened.
Last year on Braelyn's birthday Heather called to say she wanted to see her daughter. She told her parents to meet her outside the Family Dollar store on Whites Creek Pike. They met for a meal and then Heather left walking west.
Mickey Baltz returned the next day driving down the side street on which he thought he'd seen her and noticed a house that was in the backdrop of a photograph Heather had texted him once before to prove to him she had not sold his car.
He called police. Heather had outstanding probation violations.
I thought at least in jail she wouldn't be doing drugs hopefully he said. When we saw her for Braelyn's birthday it was the worst I'd ever seen her. I'm thinking 'Now I can relax. She's safe in jail.' 
In court for her hearing she cussed me as she walked out the door as she was taken into custody he said.
Heather returned home in September but did little to care for her children. She never gave them a bath. She lay on the couch much of the time.
She'd been gone two years by then Tina Baltz said. I didn't push her to get up in the morning. I would get the kids up and feed them and take them to school. I wanted to give her time.
By January Heather appeared ill. She had bronchitis-like symptoms an ear infection a sty in her eye and a large abscess on her back. A visit to the emergency room ended with her being sent home with a diagnosis of stress.
Eighteen days later Heather was dead. Doctors at another hospital diagnosed a heart infection most likely caused by intravenous drug use.
The last few weeks of Heather's life were filled with frustration. Her parents had spent years dealing with Heather's addiction.
I got upset with her because she was just laying around her father said. I told her that if you don't do something you need to get out of my house.
I cannot regret anything I did or said because it will ruin me Tina Baltz said four months after her daughter's death. Then she closed her eyes and cried.
Sunday would have been Heather's 29th birthday. After church the Baltzes plan to visit her grave with the children.
I'm sure we'll maybe have some cake and ice cream with the kids so they can celebrate their mom's birthday Mickey Baltz said.

How big is the opioid problem in Nashville
In 2016 there were 178 fatal overdoses attributed to opioids and 70 to heroin. Those statistics do not include deaths from drug-related complications or homicides and auto fatalities involving drugs.
Nashville paramedics are now administering more than 100 doses of the opioid overdose drug Narcan each week.
In September the Metro Health Department hired its first opioid response coordinator.
A needle exchange program was created to stem the risks associated with shared needles. And police fire and emergency rooms are beginning to share data to get a handle on the epidemic.
But officials acknowledge they lag behind other major cities such as Columbus Ohio and Louisville Kentucky where the opioid crisis arrived sooner and is being addressed more aggressively.
The map below shows the number of EMS runs in response to non-fatal overdose emergency calls in Davidson County by ZIP code between March 2017 and March 2018. Click on an area to see the actual number of calls.

How to get help
Need help for yourself or someone else dealing with addiction
The Tennessee REDLINE 1-800-889-9789 is a toll-free information and referral line funded by the Tennessee Department of Mental Health Substance Abuse Services.
For the first time Hayden Panettiere is opening up about a secret addiction to opioids and alcohol that nearly cost her career  and her life.
I was on top of the world and I ruined it the former Nashville star 32 says in the new issue of PEOPLE. She spent years battling her addiction as well as a devastating bout with postpartum depression. I'd think I hit rock bottom but then there's that trap door that opens.
Eventually Panettiere  who shares a 7-year-old daughter Kaya with her ex Wladimir Klitschko  was determined to get help. I put a lot of work into myself and I had to be willing to be incredibly honest says the actress who underwent both trauma therapy and inpatient treatment within the last year. Now she's returned to set to reprise her fan-favorite character Kirby Reed in the next Scream film and she's pouring her heart into her work with Hoplon International the charity she founded in March whose mission it is to raise funds for Ukraine as the country endures its fifth month of war with Russia.
This hasn't been easy and there were a lot of ups and downs says Panettiere of her journey to sobriety and happiness. But I don't regret even the ugliest things that have happened to me. I feel incredibly accomplished. And I feel like I have a second chance.
Nolwen Cifuentes
Already a star by the age of 11 after roles on soap operas and in Remember the Titans Panettiere says she was just 15 when someone on her team began to offer her happy pills before she walked the red carpets. They were to make me peppy during interviews says Panettiere. I had no idea that this was not an appropriate thing or what door that would open for me when it came to my addiction.
Watch the full episode of People Cover Story Hayden Panettiere on PeopleTV.com or on the PeopleTV app.
Panettiere was drinking alcohol and occasionally taking opioids but meanwhile her career was flourishing. My saving grace is that I couldn't be messy while on set and working says the star who landed the role of superpowered cheerleader Claire Bennet on Heroes when she was 16. But things kept getting out of control off set. And as I got older the drugs and alcohol became something I almost couldn't live without.
Chris HolloDisney General Entertainment Content
In 2014 Panettiere was starring as troubled country singer Juliette Barnes on Nashville. The actress's real-life pregnancy was written into the show and soon it became clear that her character's inner demons mirrored her own.
For more on PEOPLE's cover story with Hayden Panettiere listen below to our daily podcast PEOPLE Every Day.
Those were really tough years says Panettiere who suffered from severe postpartum depression after Kaya was born. I could relate to a lot of those storylines like the alcoholism and postpartum depression. They hit close to home.
Panettiere sought treatment for her depression but still found herself struggling  and increasingly independent on alcohol to get through the day.
I never had the feeling that I wanted to harm my child but I didn't want to spend any time with her says Panettiere who didn't drink during her pregnancy but fell off the wagon after Kaya was born. There was just this gray color in my life.
Nolwen Cifuentes
The actress would sneak away to drink and her relationship with Klitschko whom she began dating in 2009 began to crumble. He didn't want to be around me she recalls. I didn't want to be around me. But with the opiates and alcohol I was doing anything to make me feel happy for a moment. Then I'd feel worse than I did before. I was in a cycle of self-destruction.
At her lowest point I would have the shakes when I woke up and could only function with sipping alcohol says Panettiere. In 2018 the year Nashville ended the actress made the heartbreaking decision to send Kaya to live with Klitschko from whom she had split in Ukraine. It was the hardest thing I ever had to do she says. But I wanted to be a good mom to her  and sometimes that means letting them go.
The drinking worsened and eventually Panettiere was hospitalized suffering from jaundice. Doctors told me my liver was going to give out she recalls. I was no longer a 20-year-old who could just bounce right back.
Nolwen Cifuentes
Eventually Panettiere entered rehab for eight months. She credits her stay for giving her the tools to get over the hump of her addiction but it wasn't until recently that the actress says she's finally found the peace she yearned for so long.
It's an everyday choice and I'm checking in with myself all the time says Panettiere. But I'm just so grateful to be part of this world again and I will never take it for granted again.
Seven hundred and fifty four people died by drug overdose in the Nashville area last year a number that makes Davidson County the second-deadliest major metro in the country.
Fentanyl was linked to over 77 of those cases.
Overdose deaths have more than doubled since 2017 according to data kept by the Metro Public Health Department.
Davidson County has the second-highest rate in the country behind Baltimore for overdose deaths in metros over 5000000 people according to 2022 data compiled by the San Francisco Chronicle.
Shelby County was 12th in the country.
Drug overdoses have steadily risen each year in the United States since 1999 according to the CDC. In 2021 opioids accounted for 75 of those deaths.
Opioid drug overdoses hit the U.S. in three deadly waves each a consequence of the one before it.
Prescription painkillers became a leading cause of overdose deaths around 2000. When the pills became more regulated people started turning to heroin around 2007. Fentanyl began making its way into heroin around 2013 quickly becoming and remaining the leading cause of opioid overdoses.
The Chronicle in an effort to better understand the opioid epidemic created a tracker using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Here's what we learned from the drug overdose database.
Nashville-area sees most overdose deaths in Tennessee
Davidson County leads Tennessee in overdose deaths.
Shelby Knox Hamilton and Rutherford counties counted 608 532 233 and 113 deaths respectively in 2022 according to the data.
Roughly 100 people per 100000 died from an overdose in Davidson County last year.
Fentanyl accounted for 77 of those deaths. Cocaine was found in about 30 of cases while methamphetamine was found in 33 according to the health department's statistics for last year.
See how many overdose deaths were recorded in each county
Tennessee among top ten for overdose deaths in the U.S.
Tennessee is eighth in the country for overdose deaths according to the database. The CDC reported 3854 deaths across the state in 2022.
While fentanyl remains the predominate drug in overdose cases prescriptions painkillers were prevalent in just as many cases in 2021 as 2017 despite a dip in the middle years according to the Tennessee department of health.
In Tennessee over 4.3 million painkillers were prescribed in 2022 though that number has been declining since 2018 when about 6.1 million were issued.
Tennessee noted 645 cases where prescription opioids were the main drug about 17 of all overdoses according to the latest data available from the state.
Heroin peaked at 380 deaths in 2019 while fentanyl-related deaths have continued to climb since 2017 with about 74 contributed to the drug.
Here are the 10 states with the highest number of reported overdose deaths in 2022
California  11094 Florida  7675 New York  6412 Texas  5429 Pennsylvania  5201 Ohio  5141 North Carolina  4030 Tennessee  3854 Illinois  3831 Michigan  2956
Where to find help
Tennessee is abundant with recovery support services.
The state's Addiction Recovery Program serves residents who are at or below the federal poverty threshold through assessment case management spiritual support transitional housing employment skills and other services.
For those who regularly use or know someone who does having Narcan on hand can be a lifesaver.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March approved Narcan  the standard treatment to rapidly reverse the effects of an overdose  to be sold over-the-counter in pharmacies across the country.
Narcan hit the shelves last week.
The Nashville Prevention Partnership provides training on how to properly administer Narcan and care for someone who is overdosing.
There are also several syringe services programs across Tennessee that provide free sterile needles and syringes safe disposal containers testing and overdose prevention resources.
In Nashville Meharry Medical College and Nashville CARES both run clinics for safe needle exchange.
Guidance recently issued by the American Society of Addiction Medicine states that patients should have access to the full range of FDA-approved medications. Regulatory agencies including state licensing boards the ASAM said should not discriminate against the type of treatment an individual receives based on unjustified assumptions that certain treatments cause impairment.
Scott began driving for Uber to make extra money for rehab and even tried decreasing his medication dosage. In the meantime he said he faced increasingly uncomfortable questions from his employer who wanted him to stay on but wondered why he hadnt gotten his license yet. He felt torn on what to do.
Ive had 100 success with my recovery he said. What made it so hard is the science was on my side on this. What happens if I am right and then you put me into long-term treatment Who knows what happens after that
He didnt know that federal authorities at the time were actively investigating a similar scenario just two states over in Indiana.
A very strong signal
Though the protections afforded to people with substance use disorder by the Americans with Disabilities Act are more than three decades old experts say the stigma and discrimination faced by people who use buprenorphine and methadone remains endemic.
Over the years Friedman and her colleagues at the Legal Action Center have represented many clients who have been forced to make the choice between their legally prescribed medication and their livelihoods or access to services.
Weve personally witnessed people struggling with these orders to taper off she said. Suffering and kind of agonizing about whether they should go back to an appropriate dose where they were thriving or continue to taper against medical advice so that they can comply with some ill-thought-out and discriminatory order.
Until recently there had been little enforcement of ADA protections for people who take medication to treat their opioid use disorder. The Justice Department first published its argument that discrimination based on a patients use of medication was tantamount to discrimination based on disability in 2018 when it reached a settlement with a skilled nursing facility that denied admission to a patient who used Suboxone.
Since then the agency has released guidance explaining how the ADA applies to opioid use disorder and expanded its work to various contexts filing lawsuits and forcing entities into consent decrees.
The push to protect access to these medications is part of the Justice Departments overall strategy to combat the opioid epidemic. Its cases have focused on people penalized for using the medications or who have been denied access to them  including in the criminal legal system where few correctional facilities allow prisoners to use them.
Our rigorous enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act should send a clear message that the rights of people with disabilities including those with opioid use disorder must and will be protected said the DOJs Clarke. When it comes to opioid use disorder we reject discriminatory and unlawful policies and practices that are rooted in nothing more than stereotypes myths and misconceptions.
Other federal agencies including the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have also stepped up enforcement. But experts say its the DOJ that has sent the strongest signal and established critical precedent where there once was little.
Just last year it reached its first settlement resolving claims of employment discrimination based on MOUD when it required a Tennessee county to make policy changes and pay damages to a correctional officer who was pushed out of his job because he used buprenorphine. The agency found that the Cumberland County Sheriffs Office had violated the ADA by failing to make reasonable accommodations to allow him to work and use the medication.
Each time the Justice Department breaks new ground Friedman said it becomes easier for front-line attorneys to advocate for their clients in court. It also helps patients like Scott.
Like any good lawyer faced with a problem Scott began to research. He learned his medication was federally protected and then about a case remarkably similar to his own.
In March 2022 the Justice Department announced its findings that Indianas State Board of Nursing had violated the ADA by requiring that a nurse who was seeking to reinstate her license stop using buprenorphine in order to participate in a program that rehabilitates and monitors nurses with drug or alcohol addiction. The boards abstinence-only policy violated the law according to the Justice Department in part by creating barriers that screened out people who used MOUD.
Indianas nursing board denied breaking the law but agreed to pay damages and make policy revisions to ensure that nurses who use medication can remain on it while participating in a monitoring program.
Scott suddenly felt like he had something to stand on. He began to push back against TLAP.
Not fit to practice
By the fall of 2022 Scotts life had changed. Hed left his job at the law firm because he couldnt get licensed but got a new job negotiating contracts at a health care company. His first child a boy was born.
Scott had previously asked the Board of Law Examiners for more time as he tried to figure out how to comply with TLAP. He had decided he wanted to stay on buprenorphine so he asked TLAP for permission to get a second opinion this time from a Tennessee-based program hoping a new evaluation would support his use of the medication. Though TLAP granted his request by then Scott had grown increasingly frustrated with the process and traded a handful of contentious emails back and forth with the organization.
The board allowed him to postpone his final hearing to get the evaluation but warned that failure to comply with TLAP would be grounds to deny him his license.
Scott paid 6000 for the three-day evaluation submitting again to drug tests cognitive testing and extensive questioning about his criminal record and family history.
The results came a day before the hearing. When he read them his heart sank.
The physician concluded Scott had used buprenorphine for more than a decade without any legal educational or occupational deficiencies or consequences and that his criminal history was representative of living in poverty in a small community not of any underlying personality disorder.
Ultimately however he determined that Scott didnt have a foundation of recovery treatment and was not fit to practice law. The physician diagnosed Scott with mild cannabis use disorder in early remission as well as alcohol use disorder by history. Scott would later dispute both in writing to TLAP  he said he didnt drink alcohol and was able to stop his occasional use of CBD and delta-8 the THC product without issue.
Scott should follow Palmettos recommendation of attending abstinence-based treatment the physician wrote and also consider switching his medication to naltrexone.
Scott and his attorney had arguments on his criminal history prepared for his next hearing but not the new evaluation. When they arrived at his hearing they saw a representative from TLAP which had also received a copy of the report. The stakes couldnt have been higher. If the board denied his application because he hadnt complied with TLAP his bar score would expire before he could apply again.
He had one last option withdraw and reapply as a first-time applicant restarting the clock. He took it.
As he walked out of the room that day he fought back tears.
I have a lot of work to do
A year passed. By the fall of 2023 Scott was spending his days working from home beneath his unused law degree vacillating between hope and frustration. By most standards he was thriving. Hed been promoted and his nearly 2-year-old son was enchanted with his new puppy.
But he hadnt given up on his dream.
Scott reapplied for bar admission. At the end of November he was called to a hearing that would determine finally whether or not hed get to be a lawyer.
Scott received notice of the hearing on a Friday just six days before it was scheduled. He contacted a new attorney Greg Brown who had years of experience representing professionals including lawyers and doctors before licensing boards. Brown spent that night reading through Scotts file and on Saturday morning outraged over what was happening to him officially took him on as a client.
Brown worked through the weekend quickly drafting a legal strategy. He filed a response to the board stating that Scott would not comply with the requirement that he stop using his medication and attend abstinence-only treatment.
Four days later Scott and Brown walked into a hearing room near the Capitol building in Nashville and sat at a white folding table facing four attorneys with the Board of Law Examiners. They expected to go head to head with TLAP and lose and were prepared Brown said to file a federal civil rights claim afterward.
But no one from TLAP was at the hearing. Right away according to the hearing transcript the board made clear it didnt want to discuss Scotts medication or his noncompliance with TLAP at all. Though Scott had filed dozens of pages of supplemental material since the board first referred him to TLAP in 2021  including court records reference letters and detailed explanations of his legal record  the board wanted to focus its questioning on his past conduct. That included his criminal history but also his communications with TLAP and the board which had grown increasingly heated as time passed.
Scotts past and his behavior during the licensure process were troubling an attorney representing the board said at the hearing. His conduct demonstrates that there is a lack of accountability for his actions and long history of conduct that gives rise to certain criminal arrests and then an inability again to control his temper he said.
Scott testified on his own behalf explaining his past criminal charges and apologizing for lashing out at TLAP.
The board highlighted one particular email that Scott sent to Buddy Stockwell TLAPs executive director after he withdrew his application the year before. In it he stated he was looking forward to working with the Justice Department to fix the character and fitness process in Tennessee. It may be funny to you guys but Ive worked my ass off and I have a family to provide for. This isnt over yet Scott wrote.
The board said it didnt want to get into anything regarding the DOJ according to the transcript. But it asked Scott to explain himself.
I was very emotional Scott testified. It hurt. I worked very hard to get here and he had made requirements that I could not overcome.
Brown began pressing the issue. The assessment Scott received before his last hearing he pointed out to the board concluded that Mr. Scott was not fit to practice law because hes on Suboxone treatment. Thats what it says.
He asked if he could bring Scotts doctor in to speak. I dont think that that is our focus a board member said. That  the  any fitness issues or the particular treatment that hes chosen to treat his addictions.
Brown called Scotts doctor anyway. For the first time he testified before the board saying he had no concerns about Scotts fitness to practice law and that he had also treated other professional patients including doctors and lawyers with buprenorphine.
Other witnesses followed offering glowing assessments of Scotts character. After several hours of testimony the board broke to deliberate. Scott steeled himself for bad news.
When they returned the board announced Scott would get his license without any conditions. Scott wouldnt have to talk to TLAP again. It was over.
I bet my eyes were big Scott recalled. I was thinking This is unbelievable.
Before the hearing ended a board member told Scott that the licensure process would have gone a lot easier if he had communicated better. Conflict she advised was an inevitable part of practicing law.
Scott nodded and thanked her. I dont plan to be back before any board ever again he said.
A month later and nearly three years after he passed the bar exam Scott stood in a courtroom in front of a judge and the Tennessee state flag with his right hand raised.
As his son watched him swear his oath of admission to the bar he thought about the price he paid to get there. But he also thought of his grandmother Nellie and how proud she would have been to see it.
Now I have a lot of work to do he said. Its just the beginning.
Fentanyl is flooding the streets of downtown Nashville and business owners are saying they're seeing drug deals go down in broad daylight.
Metro health leaders say Tennessee ranks top five in the country for drug overdoses and Metro Nashville Health Department says we are in the deadliest phase of this narcotic epidemic with overdose deaths rapidly increasing.
City leaders called to have a meeting Tuesday to raise awareness about these issues affecting everyone not just drug users.
Tanja Jacobs lost her 22-year-old son in Nashville to a drug overdose.
It changes your life. Your life will never be the same Jacobs emphasized.
She said her son thought he was buying cocaine but it was laced with fentanyl.
They were lied to they were deceived what they asked for is not what they had gotten and thats why theyre gone Jacobs said.
Jacobs said her son did not have a substance use disorder and that he was recreationally using this drug.
The Metro Police undercover sergeant said Tuesday that no recreational drugs in Nashville are safe anymore.
He said they are finding fentanyl in all different types of drugs like cocaine Xanax Adderall and more.
FOX 17 News Kaitlin Miller asked I know theres a concern with tourism with all the drugs found on Broadway. Do you think this could really impact the reputation of this city
The sergeant responded Thats certainly something were trying to avoid. Our operations in the downtown corridor have been highly successful and they will continue to be highly successful.
Metro's Health Department says there were 336 overdose deaths in Davidson County in 2017 725 overdose deaths in 2021 and theyre expecting this number to be even higher for 2022.
The police sergeant said more needs to be done especially in the downtown corridor.
I personally would like to see the increased availability of Narcan or naloxone which is the drug that will reverse the effects of an opioid overdose the sergeant explained.
He said this is the number one issue they're trying to combat right now so hopefully other mothers won't have to go through the pain Jacobs did a few years ago.
City leaders say this need to be an all-hands-on-deck approach with local organizations law enforcement agencies schools and more.
They say its going to take the whole community to help raise awareness.

The overdose problem in Tennessee the lives were losing the families that are torn apart thats not someone elses problem. Thats all of our problem said TDMHSAS Commissioner Marie Williams LCSW. We want to reduce the stigma of addiction and celebrate the courage that it takes to say I need help. Substance use disorder happens to people in all walks of life for any number of reasons but the hope of a new life in recovery is real. We see it every day.
We stand in unity with our State partners and all who have a stake in advocating for compassion education and harm reduction in combatting the tragic toll of substance misuse said State Health Commissioner Ralph Alvarado M.D. F.A.C.P. Let us recommit ourselves to the joint effort that is needed to save lives reduce stigma and create a healthier community state and world for all.
Drug overdoses continue to impact far too many families in our state said TBI Director David Rausch. Today and every day Im grateful for our partners who continue to do everything we can to try to tackle this crisis from all sides. We cant do it alone though. If you need help get it. And if you know someone struggling with addiction do everything you can to convince them to take their first steps toward healing. Doing so might just save a life.
As many lives as have been lost to overdose tens of thousands of Tennesseans have been saved thanks to the hard work of the Regional Overdose Prevention Specialists. Since October 2017 the ROPS have distributed more than one million doses of naloxone and trained hundreds of thousands of Tennesseans on how to reverse an opioid overdose and save a life.
Correction A previous version of this story misstated the date range reported by Metro Public Health. Davidson County reported 10 overdose deaths between May 30 and June 5 2019.
A spike in recent fatal overdoses could be tied to fentanyl-laced drugs in Davidson County public safety officials have warned
Between May 30 and June 10 the Davidson County Medical Examiner's office has investigated at least 10 deaths believed to be fatal drug overdoses according to Metro Public Health.
Of those deaths half have been associated with an unknown white or brown powder .
Tox screens are pending but we know drug dealers are mixing heroin and cocaine with cheaper and deadly fentanyl the Metro Nashville Police Department said in a Twitter post.
In 2018 the medical examiner's office reported 344 drug-related overdoses in the county or just less than one per day. Since May 31 there have been on average more than 1.5 likely overdose deaths per day according to the data from Metro Health.
While the exact causes of the deaths have not been confirmed MNPD and Metro Health hope to warn users and the public about the growing threat.
How deadly is fentanyl in Nashville
Pharmaceutical fentanyl is a synthetic opioid pain reliever approved for treating severe pain typically advanced cancer pain according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine.
Most recent cases of fentanyl-related overdoses and death are from illegally-made fentanyl which is often mixed into heroin or cocaine sometimes without the users knowledge the CDC said.
Statewide 1776 Tennesseans died in drug overdoses in 2017 up from 1631 the prior year according data released by the Tennessee Department of Health last year. It marks at least the sixth year in a row that the death toll rose.
In 2017 105 people in Nashville suffered fatal overdoses with fentanyl in their bloodstream  four more than the overdose total for heroin  according to data released last May by city police and the Metro Public Health Department.
Although the margin between the death tolls is small officials are most concerned about the swift rise of the fentanyl which has spread through the city faster than heroin ever did.
Fentanyl-related overdoses were nearly unheard of in Nashville only a few years ago but deaths rose 250 percent in 2015 then 54 percent in 2016 and 75 percent in 2017.
How to help during an overdose
If there is an immediate health crisis residents are encouraged to call 911 or go to the emergency room.
In 2014 Tennessee passed the Good Samaritan Law allowing residents to become trained in the use of Naxolone or Narcan a medicine that can help sustain the life of someone overdosing until more complete medical care is available.
For more information on how to become trained in the use of Naxolone visit hwww.tn.govhealthhealth-program-areashealth-professional-boardscsmd-boardcsmd-boardnaloxone-training-information.
Metro Public Health has also identified several avenues for assistance in the case of a drug problem.

Nashville TN  What if you could clean out clutter prevent addiction and protect the quality of your drinking water all at the same time This Saturday you can
The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services TDMHSAS state and local government partners dozens of substance use prevention coalitions and law enforcement agencies are teaming up for National Prescription Drug Take Back Day this Saturday April 27th 2024.
There are more than 110 locally organized events across Tennessee with most scheduled for 1000am to 200pm local time.
Find a Take Back Day Event near you using this Interactive Map
Take Back Day is an opportunity for anyone to safely and securely dispose of medications in their home that are either expired or no longer needed. In 2023 Tennesseans disposed of nearly 13000 pounds of medications across the two Take Back Days in April and October.
Chances are good you have prescription medications that you dont need anymore. Disposal is easy and fast at one of our Take Back Day events. With prescription opioids and other medications theres risk of misuse and potential addiction. By getting them out of your house you might prevent years of heartache or even save a life said TDMHSAS Commissioner Marie Williams LCSW.
Safe and secure disposal of prescription drugs protects public health and Tennessees waterways said David Salyers commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.

With the death toll rising and the flow of opiates from Big Pharma unabated state prosecutors and the Tennessee Attorney Generals office are locked in a legal battle for power and money.
Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery III is challenging the legal authority of 14 state district attorneys general to sue Big Pharma and its partners in the opiate supply chain and insisting they had no right to engage a private law firm.
The DAs  representing 47 counties in Middle and East Tennessee - contend Slatery sat idly by as the opioid epidemic decimated their communities so they took matters into their own hands under state laws they say give them the right to hire a law firm and mount their own legal fight against Big Pharma and its partners.
MoreHard-won compromise likely means limits for first-time opioid prescriptions in Tennessee
Nashville law firm Branstetter Stranch and Jennings last year filed lawsuits in several state courts including circuit courts in Campbell and Sullivan counties on behalf of state prosecutors in judicial districts throughout East and Middle Tennessee against Big Pharma and its partners including distributors.
Slaterys office earlier this week filed motions to intervene in those cases  nine months after the first such lawsuit was filed.
Legal documents and letters obtained by USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee show the two sides arent just warring over authority. Money  who gets it and where it goes  is also at the root of the disagreement on how best to hold Big Pharma and its partners legally and financially accountable for the opioid epidemic.
In depthThe science behind the Tennessee opioid crisis
InvestigationHow many lives are lost to opioids No one knows.
Slaterys office has repeatedly said it was investigating the possibility of suing Big Pharma but has yet to do so. But Slatery was recently tapped to lead a committee of attorneys general across the nation formed at the direction of a federal judge in Ohio who is pushing for a fast settlement with Big Pharma.
Is 'global settlement' a money grab
He argued in a letter to the DAs that he was much better positioned than they to get the state a share of that money and their lawsuits were interfering with the possibility of what he termed a global settlement.
My office has devoted significant resources to this issue and is leading a coalition of approximately 40 states actively investigating opioid manufacturers and distributors.  we have the ability to seek relief for the state and its political subdivisions through a global resolution. Your litigation complicates that effort.
MoreScott Campbell counties hop on board Big Pharma racketeering lawsuit train
The DAs fired back that local communities  not the state  have borne the costs of the opioid epidemic and local communities should be afforded the lions share of any damages that might result from Big Pharma litigation. Slaterys proposed global settlement they argue is a money grab for state coffers.
We know the idea of rolling up various opioid-related lawsuits into one settlement can seem appealing especially when Big Pharma is already pleading poverty - despite billions in revenue generated at the expense of our citizens a letter on behalf of the DAs read. That said we also know that in these situations local communities lose out.
They noted the state attorney generals office  under Slaterys predecessor  was part of a 2007 settlement with Purdue Pharma the manufacturer of widely abused opioid OxyContin.
In that case Tennessee received roughly 720000 of the 19.5 million settlement. Of that money 400000 went to cover attorneys fees for the attorney general according to the district attorneys.
The DAs also pointed out the attorney generals office had authority under that settlement to force Big Pharma and its partners to reveal when communities received shipments of more opiates than population but did nothing.
The terms of the settlement went unenforced and Tennessee settled its claims for pennies on the dollar the DAs letter stated. The limited monies that were received went into state coffers in Nashville not into the hands of the smaller communities bearing the greatest need.
The results of this failed effort have been another decade lost to growing opioid-fueled abuse addiction and death the letter stated. Our local communities have been devastated in this wake and we cannot and we must not fail again.
Lying about opiates' addictive properties
There are two sets of tracks being laid across the nation in what is shaping up to be a Big Tobacco-style legal fight to force Big Pharma to cough up money for the addiction its wares have wrought. Like Big Tobacco Big Pharma and its partners are accused of lying about the addictive properties of opiates.
The DAs are opting for state court action and are using state laws they argue give them specific authority to do so including the Drug Dealer Liability Act.
Others including the county commissions of Campbell and Scott counties are using racketeering laws and federal court where U.S. District Judge Dan Aaron Polster of Ohio has already been tapped to try to marshal whats known as a multidistrict litigation or MDL.
He is urging a speedy tough settlement of the more than 200 lawsuits that have been filed on behalf of local governments and hospitals and other groups across the nation in the past two years. Slatery has been participating in conferences helmed by Polster.
Jonathan Taylor with the Knoxville firm Taylor  Knight and Nashville firm Lieff Cabraser Heimann  Bernstein have filed MDL actions against Big Pharma on behalf of several East and Middle Tennessee county governments. Like the DAs county governments also are trying to ensure any money reaped from Big Pharma goes back to local communities Taylor said.
A number of county commissions that we represent in Tennessee have recognized their responsibilities to taxpayers and have understood the urgency of bringing these lawsuits now Taylor said.
Slatery has not filed any challenges to those MDL cases. In response to questions from USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee on Wednesday Slatery's office pointed to an opinion column Slatery recently wrote.
In that column Slatery made clear he is backing the MDL settlement effort.
We believe the best course of action is the one we are taking - a multi-state investigation that focuses on preparing for litigation with the possibility of a comprehensive settlement Slatery wrote.
A war with AG's office
Stephen Crump who serves as district attorney general for the 10th Judicial District in Southeast Tennessee said he and his fellow DAs dont want a war with Slaterys office but feel compelled to act.
I think its a shame in a war that ought to be us against them its started out as us against us Crump said. We have acted as they sat. We hope that they will join us in this but we will not go away. The only group that benefits from their actions would be the opioid manufacturers. Its certainly not Tennesseans.
Jared Effler a district attorney general whose district includes Campbell and Claiborne counties pointed on Wednesday to the 2007 settlement as proof he and his fellow DAs were right to file suit.
That settlement failed to provide any resources to our rural communities and has allowed the opioid epidemic to explode he said. For me to sit by and allow the failures of the AG'S 2007 settlement to repeat themselves would be a dereliction of my duties to the citizens of the 8th Judicial District.
Campbell County currently ranks third in the nation for the number of opiate prescriptions as a percentage of population with a rate of 195 prescriptions for every 100 citizens. Claiborne County ranks seventh.
Hearings on the motion to intervene filed by Slaterys office have not yet been set.

A suspected drug dealer in Nashville has been arrested on charges of second-degree murder and second-degree attempted murder after one man died and another suffered serious medical issues from fentanyl-laced heroin the suspect is believed to have given them.
Derrick Huey 18 of Meadow Court was arrested on the homicide counts Wednesday evening a day after being charged with selling heroin.
A police news release sent out Thursday said the charges against Huey are from the first prosecution of its kind but likely not the last.
East Precinct officers responded to a death call at 3 Fern Ave. on Jan. 26 and found James Roy Richardson Jr. 41 dead on the floor. Jack F. Delocatera 42 was found in the living room and told police he couldn't walk.
A white powder that field tested positive for heroin was found in Delocateras bedroom police said in the news release. Autopsy findings from the medical examiner showed that Richardson died from a lethal dose of fentanyl an extremely potent substance some suppliers mix with heroin.
Police said Delocatera said he purchased 50 worth of heroin and split it with Richardson. Detectives used cell phone information to identify Huey as Delocatera's suspected dealer. Huey later admitted to police that he sold cocaine and heroin in the area.
Huey is jailed in lieu of 100000 bond.
Police said investigations similar to the one involving Huey are continuing by Metro detectives.
Heroin interdiction continues to be a priority for the police department police said in the release. Dealers should know of the potential for overdose deaths becoming homicide investigations. Likewise users should be cognizant that any heroin they buy could unknowing to them contain an illicit form of fentanyl that is contributing to deaths across the nation.

NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  Tuesday May 9 marks National Fentanyl Awareness Day as efforts continue to shed light on the deadly drug. It's one that has caused more overdose deaths than ever before.
The drug has caused a lot of problems in Nashville. In just the first quarter of 2023 there have been more than 140 suspected drug overdose deaths. Of those fentanyl played a part in more than 75 percent of them.
Health experts and leaders across the country are sounding the alarm yet again about how potent this drug can be. Nationwide fentanyl is involved in more deaths of people under 50 than any other cause of death including heart disease cancer homicide and suicide.
According to the CDC more than 107000 people in the U.S. died of drug overdoses and drug poisonings between January 2021 and January 2022. A staggering 67 percent of those deaths involved synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Some of those deaths were tied to fentanyl mixed with other illicit drugs like cocaine meth and heroin.
It only takes two milligrams of fentanyl for it to be considered a potentially lethal dose and it's a drug thats especially dangerous for someone who does not have a tolerance to opioids.
A tranquilizer meant for veterinarian use has been linked to a growing number of drug overdose deaths in Tennessee.
Xylazine has been found in fentanyl heroin and other drugs according to a November notice from the Food and Drug Administration. It appears Naloxone which is administered in an effort to reverse the overdose effects of opioids may not have an impact on Xylazine according to the FDA.
Xylazine is making the deadliest drug threat our country has every faced fentanyl even deadlier DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said. DEA has seized xylazine and fentanyl mixtures in 48 of 50 States. The DEA Laboratory System is reporting that in 2022 approximately 23 of fentanyl powder and 7 of fentanyl pills seized by the DEA contained xylazine.
Evidence of the drug in Tennessee has nearly doubled each year for the last two years though Xylazine does not show up on a standard toxicology screen so cases could be underreported according to the FDA.
From 2020 to 2021 overdose deaths across Tennessee where Xylazine was present increased from 56 to 94 according to a report published by the Tennessee Department of Health in November.
At the time Davidson County was third in the state for deaths behind Shelby and Knox counties.
Since then the drug has been classified as an emerging substance in Nashville according to quarterly reports published by the Metro Public Health Department.
Xylazine has been increasingly detected among suspected overdose deaths during the last two years according to the last quarter's report.
The department first included Xylazine in their 2021 fourth quarter report where it was found in 2.7 of overdose deaths about 20 cases. In 2020 about 8 cases 1.3 of overdose deaths included the drug.
Last year nearly 40 overdose cases involved Xylazine.
A man living in the same apartment building as a woman killed in a fatal drug overdose after Christmas is now facing a murder charge in connection with her death.
Johnny Wayne Tucker 73 was indicted by a Davidson County grand jury on a charge of second-degree murder Metro Nashville police said in a statement Wednesday.
MoreNashville metro had second-highest rate of overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2022 report says
Emergency services were called to an apartment at the Curb Victory Hall a building for veterans experiencing homelessness on Christmas morning. Caroline Black 35 was rushed from the scene to a hospital after she was found unconscious police said.
Black died two days later and medical examiners determined she died from fentanyl toxicity.
Tucker according to court records supplied Black with heroin that was laced with fentanyl.
It looks like just a few grains of salt too small to taste but hiding in these tiny white crystals is an unpredictable power to kill.
This is fentanyl the new deadliest drug in Nashville.
Fentanyl killed more people than heroin in Davidson County for the first time ever last year signaling that the core of the local opioid crisis has shifted to a new tier of powerful and dangerous drugs. As Tennessee has tightened its grip on prescription medication many addicts have abandoned doctor shopping in favor of black market heroin and counterfeit pills that are often laced with fentanyl a synthetic cheap-to-produce incredibly potent opioid that was once barely known outside of hospitals. For most people two milligrams is a lethal dose.
The streets are being flooded with fentanyl and its contaminating these other drugs  whether they are heroin or cocaine or counterfeit oxycodone said Dr. Howard Taylor a toxicologist who has witnessed fentanyl spread through Nashville one blood test at a time. Its out there its cheaper and its much more deadly.
MOREFentanyl is killing addicts throughout Tennessee. What is it
MORETennesse police find fentanyl found in cocaine for the first time
In 2017 105 people in Nashville suffered fatal overdoses with fentanyl in their bloodstream  four more than the overdose total for heroin  according to data released Wednesday by city police and the Metro Public Health Department. Although the margin between the death tolls is small officials are most concerned about the swift rise of the fentanyl which has spread through the city faster than heroin ever did. Fentanyl-related overdoses were nearly unheard of in Nashille only a few years ago but deaths rose 250 percent in 2015 then 54 percent in 2016 and 75 percent in 2017.
Although alarming experts described this rise as a predictable evolution of the opioid crisis which shifts from pills to heroin to fentanyl mostly as a result of simple economics. In a series of interviews with law enforcement government officials and medical professionals sources told The Tennessean that the fentanyl deaths show the opioid crisis had deepened to a new stage where drugs are cheaper to make addiction is harder to stop and the risk of fatal overdose is far greater.
And death it turns out is no deterrent. Asked to explain the severity of the crisis police and public health officials told the same story in separate interviews When word gets out that a bad batch of fentanyl has killed a few people many addicts dont try to avoid it.
They go looking for it.
From what we understand the addicts want that said Rachel Franklin a Metro Health official who coordinates responses to mass overdoses. They want the biggest high they can find. They want to go the brink and possibly get brought back with Narcan and not tip over that edge. Its a crazy concept.
Two years ago we thought we were going to come in and say You dont want this fentanyl stuff. It is deadly even as small as a grain of sand. Franklin added. But that is when they say  Where is it
Tennessee's evolving crisis
Tennessees opioid crisis was primarily recognized in 2012 when it became widely known that pill abuse was rampant and that the state had one of the highest rates of pain medicine prescriptions in the nation. Many addictions began with legitimate ailments but then patients began visiting multiple clinics to get redundant prescriptions called doctor shopping to feed a growing dependence to opioids.
MoreOpioid overdoses are rising faster among Latinos. Here's why.
Often these addicts would later transition to heroin which provides a similar high to prescription pills but can be bought in bigger doses for lower prices on the street. And as Tennessee lawmakers tightened restrictions on pain meds  for example creating a database that checks patients for duplicate prescriptions  addicts found it was easier to acquire heroin than pills.
The next shift was almost inevitable. Where the heroin market grows fentanyl is destined to follow.
Fentanyl is cheaper to make than heroin and as much as 50 times more potent so some drug traffickers maximize their profits by selling weak heroin bolstered with fentanyl  a mixture that will kill if the fentanyl is not diluted enough. Dealers have also begun using fentanyl that has been strengthened at the chemical level called fentanyl analogues which can be thousands of times more potent than heroin said Tommy Farmer special agent in charge of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations drug division.
Fentanyl and fentanyl analogues hide in heroin like minuscule landmines waiting to be stumbled upon by an unsuspecting addict. TBI also found fentanyl in cocaine for the first time last year making the party drug  already notorious for overdoses  riskier than ever.
MoreRevolving door of despair Drugs land more women behind bars
It's basically a matter of Russian Roulette I dont care what your tolerance is Farmer said. Youve got dealers with something as small as a gram that can potentially replace a kilo of heroin. There is no way they can get the doses right.
In Nashville Metro Police are now encountering fentanyl-laced heroin so frequently that street cops have been told not test heroin in the field so they don't accidentally inhale a dangerous dose on a windy day.
Sgt. Gene Donegan of the Metro Police's Major Case Task Force said the department is also on the lookout for carfentanil a fentanyl analogue known to be 100 times stronger than regular fentanyl and 5000 times stronger then heroin.
As absurd as it may sound there is a demand he said.
To any any layperson they would think Holy cow I need to stay away from that Donelson said. But to the addict the first thing they think its thats a more intense high then Ive ever had.
And unfortunately it ends up killing them.
MORESuspected drug dealer caught with 40 grams of fentanyl
Fake oxycodone real danger
Despite Tennessee's tighter restrictions on prescription pain pills not all addicts make the jump to heroin. But that still doesnt mean they are safe from fentanyl.
Farmer said the drug is frequently found in counterfeit oxycodone that is made with pill presses in rudimentary black market drug labs. TBI busted 12 counterfeit operations last year but fake pills continue to circulate the state including throughout Nashville.
In a way these pills can be more dangerous than heroin because buyers believe they are taking a professional product with familiar standardized dosage.
In reality the pills could be made of anything.
Inside we find everything from heroin to fentanyl aspirin to nothing and chemicals that we dont know what they are Farmer said. But generally we dont find the one thing they are looking for  oxycodone.
Statewide fentanyl deaths surpassed in heroin in 2016 showing that the progression of Nashvilles crisis is not unique in Tennessee. However statewide overdose data from 2017 has not been released yet so it is unclear if fentanyl is spreading through the state as fast as it is spreading in Nashville.

In the first 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic a record number of Americans died from drug overdoses. Although months of data is still incomplete statistics show that most of the deaths involve the potent drug fentanyl.
According to the National Institute of Drug Abuse fentanyl is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. In the new series Poisoned which explores the devastation caused by fentanyl ABC News Live examines how many parents are learning the deadly reality of the drug only after their children have suffered a fatal overdose.
Tanja Jacobs spoke to ABC News Live. ABC
Romello Marchman grew up in Nashville Tennessee. His mother said that he was a typical 22-year-old man who loved video games and cars.
He was a young man like so many others out there said Tanja Jacobs. They are stressed they are worried. The pandemic keeps them away from their friends. They can't go to school.
During the pandemic Romello Marchman died from cocaine laced with fentanyl according to Jacobs.
He got it from his friends. And it's the only reason why he took it is because he did get it from his friends and he did trust them said Jacobs.
Last year Tennessee had the third highest overdose death rate in the country according to the National Institute of Drug Abuse.
Trevor Henderson is the former director of the Nashville Overdose Response and Reduction Program. ABC
In the Nashville area between 75 and 80 of our fatal overdoses will involve fentanyl at this point in time said Trevor Henderson the former director of the Nashville Overdose Response and Reduction Program.
That statistic accounts for the death of Frankita Davis.
Betty Davis said her daughter was diagnosed with cancer when she was 17 years old and that doctors had prescribed her pain medication. One day a friend offered her daughter a pain-reliever pill that they did not know was laced with fentanyl the mother said.

She chose to take a pill but she didn't choose to die said Davis.
Fentanyl which was originally made for sedation during surgery is one of the most powerful opioids ever created. Fentanyl-related fatalities began to skyrocket nationwide after drug dealers and cartels began to lace the chemical into drugs that they were already selling often targeting addicted users looking for a more powerful high according to the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.
A few grains of fentanyl will make you high. A couple more will kill you said Sam Quinones who authored a book on the U.S. opioid crisis. It's just so potent and so profitable Dealers are seeing that this is something they could sell in all manner of ways and to all manner of customers.
Candice Sexton a Nashville coroner keeps a growing list of people dying with fentanyl in their systems. In 2016 her office noted 102 deaths related to fentanyl in middle Tennessee alone.
Every year since those numbers have nearly doubled Sexton said.

It was just mind boggling she added.
In 2021 Sextons office reported nearly 1200 fentanyl-related deaths. She said she expects 2022 to be even higher.
We are on track for it to be worse said Sexton. We have outgrown our cooler. We have a FEMA trailer that they're allowing us to use as well for additional storage.

In 2018 I remember people coming in for heroin said Bogard. Now nobody's coming in saying I'm here for heroin. People are walking in the door saying I'm here for fentanyl.
Naloxone otherwise known as Narcan reverses an opioid overdose. First responders said they are often administering multiple doses of Narcan just to resuscitate one person.
In Nashville Henderson leads a small team of five people monitoring the fentanyl epidemic. One of their main goals is to distribute Narcan in parts of the city that have high numbers of overdoses.
We can identify hotspots of activity. So we can look at ZIP codes that are hit particularly hard said Henderson.
Unfortunately the growing number of fentanyl-related deaths is not unique to Nashville but a scene playing out across the country. Like many other parents Jacobs has been trying to spread the word about the dangers of fentanyl.
She said she is against the use of the word overdose and prefers to use the word poison.
If you take too much of something you overdose. You might or might not die she said. But once that fentanyl is in there if you get something you havent asked for and then you die from it - it's poisoning which makes it a murder.

NASHVILLE Tenn.--The Tennessee Board of Judicial Conduct is calling on the State Legislature to remove a local judge from her post due to alleged substance abuse issues and a failure to comply with terms of her previous suspensions.
In a  the recommendation by the board centers around Judge A. Melissa Boyd who serves as a Criminal Court Judge in the 30th Judicial District in Shelby County.
According to the recommendation Judge Boyd has received two public reprimands since taking the role in September 2022. One reprimand cited from May 8 2023 states within weeks of Judge Boyd assuming office she solicited resources and cash donations on social media for the benefit of a third party. Judge Boyd is said to have ignored the Board's inquiry into the matter but agreed to accept the reprimand.
On May 22 2023 Judge Boyd was suspended following allegations from a campaign manager who also had personal relations with the judge. According to affidavits filed by the former campaign manager the woman claims she discovered a plate with a spoon and what is believed to have been cocaine in the Judge's home closet. The affidavit states Judge Boyd admitted it was cocaine to the campaign manager and also admitted to smoking marijuana multiple times since being elected.
The affidavits go on to allege Judge Boyd was also seen outside the campaign manager's property in January 2023 taking pictures of the woman's car and property which she then texted to the woman. The affidavit stated Judge Boyd allegedly sent more texts asking who is the whore seriously Judge Body also allegedly sent the woman pictures of her prior marriage license and information about her divorce which made the woman feel disturbed.
The Board memo adds following the suspensions the Board gave Judge Boyd an opportunity to resign in November of last year but did not respond nor had she addressed substance abuse issues. In December of last year Judge Boyd was indicted on charges of coercion of a witness and harassment. Judge Boyd responded she had ultimately entered a rehab facility after the specified required dates and accused the Board of piling on her by keeping her off the bench.

U.S. drug overdose deaths in 2020 eclipsed all records in recorded history according to the Centers for Disease Control.
More than 81000 people died last year nationwide  a 34 increase from 2019  primarily from overdosing on synthetic opioids.
In Tennessee the latest available figure is 2089 overdose deaths in 2019  15 above 2018 and an all-time high per the Tennessee Department of Health.
While COVID-19 dominated headlines the opioid epidemic still rages and is worsening. However there are concerted efforts to assist people addicted to drugs to heal and to help them return to normal life.
Among them are the 21st District Recovery Court that serves Hickman Lewis Perry and Williamson counties.
Jeff Moseley board president of 21st District Recovery Court is my guest on this episode of the Tennessee Voices podcast and we discussed how the drug court works and how people of all socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds suffer from the disease of addiction.
The court's work was especially tough during the strictest of COVID restrictions when support groups could not meet in person.
However recovery meetings switched to video conferencing and the work continued to help clients as best as possible avoid falling into further distress and legal trouble.
The 21st District Court reports that 65 to 70 of drug court graduates remain arrest-free.

Too many Tennesseans are dying of drug overdoses every year. In 2022  the most recent data available  3826 Tennesseans died a of a drug overdose. Of those deaths most involved an illicit illegal opioid fentanyl . With training and the opioid overdose reversal drug naloxone you can stop an overdose and save a life.
What is an opioid overdose
When too much of an opioid is taken it can slow breathing to a dangerously low rate. When breathing slows too much or stops an overdose death can occur. Overdose reversal medications displace the opioids in the brain and help the person to start breathing again.
Any time an overdose is suspected call 911 immediately and stay with the person until first responders arrive. Administer the overdose reversal medication naloxone if you have it. Additional doses of overdose reversal medications may be needed if breathing has not restarted after 2-3 minutes once a dose has been given. If substances other than opioids are involved additional medical attention may be needed.
Overdose reversal medications are proven tool against overdose death. The most common product used outside of medical settings is a medication called naloxone or known by one of the brand name products Narcan. Naloxone can be given through a nasal spray brand names RiVive Narcan and Kloxxado through an autoinjector brand name Zimhi or from a vial with syringe. Nalfemene brand name Opvee has also been recently released.
Overdose reversal medications are not dangerous are not addictive and have no potential for misuse. While training is no longer required for protection under the Good Samaritan Act training it is highly recommended so that people can recognize and respond to an overdose effectively and efficiently.
If you want to learn more about how you can reverse an overdose and connect to free training and resources for yourself or for a group please reach out to the Regional Overdose Prevention Specialist who serves your area. You can find their contact information at this link.

NASHVILLE Tenn. AP - A new report on drug overdose deaths as of 2015 in Tennessee says that the fatalities are primarily white mostly male and increasingly less likely to have prescriptions for the drugs.
The Tennessean reports httptnne.ws2qlTEwa  that a Tennessee Department of Health report obtained Wednesday indicates a surge of overdose deaths between 2012 and 2015 in the state with most stemming from overdoses on opioids including heroin and fentanyl. As an opioid crisis sweeps the country Tennessee has had 22 drug overdose deaths for every 100000 residents and 14 nonfatal overdoses for every death.
The report says that more than 86 percent of overdose fatalities in 2015 were white and more than 55 percent were male. Deaths have climbed even as prescription distribution tightens indicating illicit obtainment.

Information from The Tennessean httpwww.tennessean.com
A Tennessee doctor who relocated to Indiana after at least four of his patients died of drug overdoses was indicted this week on federal over-prescribing charges.
Dr. Darrel Rinehart who treated patients in Columbia until 2017 has been charged with 19 counts of prescribing controlled substances without a legitimate medical purpose according to a news release from the Department of Justice.
Bonnie Blackburn whose son Mathew died of an overdose while under Rineharts treatment in 2015 said she had hoped the doctor would be criminally charged but always doubted this day would come.
Yippee yee-haw hallelujah. I hope they put him under the jail she said.
OPIOID CRACKDOWNWhat Tennessee doctors were charged We've got a list.
Rinehart is one of 60 medical professionals who were charged as part of a nationwide probe designed to combat the opioid crisis in federal court. Thirty-two of those defendants were charged in Tennessee.
The indictment states that four of Rinehart's patients died while in his care but a joint investigation by The Tennessean and The Indianapolis Star published earlier this year revealed an even higher death toll.
According to the joint investigation at least five of Rineharts patients suffered fatal overdoses that were partially or wholly caused by drugs he prescribed between March 2015 and January 2016 records state. Health officials are also suspicious of two more deaths of patients who were taking Rineharts prescriptions but they were not autopsied because Rinehart told investigators the patients were killed by natural causes.
Six more patients had nonfatal overdoses between 2014 and 2016 according to an expert's review of Rinehart's medical records. One of those patients to whom Rinehart prescribed at least 11 different drugs overdosed three times.
DARREL RINEHARTOne doctor five deadly overdoses What we know about the victims
Finally Rinehart was caught on undercover video increasing a patients opioid prescription without any examination and adding an Adderall prescription after the patient casually asked for something to help me focus.
The Tennessee Board of Medical of Examiners suspended Rinehart's medical license but stopped short of revoking it after the doctor promised to never attempt to practice medicine in Tennessee again. State attorneys had argued for full revocation.
This is a pattern of negligence and bad practice that extends to anything he tries to do with his license here or anywhere in this country Samuel Moore a government attorney said while describing Rineharts prescriptions to a state licensing board.
This isnt medicine. This is something else.

To begin 2023 Tennessee prisons added another layer of screening with new scanners that can see contraband inside bodies.
Listen
A cardboard box at the post office. Thats how Judy Fritts brother-in-law came home. Last month he died of a suspected drug overdose at a private prison in Hartsville Tennessee. Now hes a pile of ashes.
They did an autopsy. Were waiting on the results from that she says. And they just pretty much said you know that that they were sorry for our loss. And that was it.
Fritts was shocked at first. But then she started scrolling through a Facebook group where she read one post after the next about people who had lost brothers and fathers in the same facility. She realized that what had happened to her brother-in-law has become increasingly common within Tennessees prisons.
As overdoses have spiked nationwide during the pandemic they have also ravaged the facilities that are supposed to be most secure. Neither barbed wire nor X-ray screenings have kept out deadly substances.
Drug deaths have jumped more than eightfold in Tennessees prisons in just the past two years from six in 2019 to 49 last year. Nearly all were from the highly potent opioid fentanyl. That has left people inside their loved ones and even officials feeling desperate.
I think everybody just needs to remember that somewhere somewhere people are loving the people that are in prison Fritts says. Theyre human being and they have families that are grieving on the outside.
If hes in prison he shouldnt be able to get drugs
Fritts says she and her family had been loving her brother-in-law from afar for years. She says he had cycled in and out of prison spent some time on the street and gotten addicted to drugs somewhere along the way. His father also struggled with substance use and died of an overdose.
When he was locked up again a few years ago Fritts was actually a little relieved. At least he would have a warm place to sleep. She thought he would be safe.
I guess I was kind of naïve about the way the whole prison worked she says. I was thinking if hes in prison he shouldnt be able to get drugs.
Now Fritts feels torn.
Somebodys an adult and in charge of their own life and they need to take responsibility for themselves she says.
But she also feels guilty  like she should have done more to protect him.
I thought if somebody does something wrong and theyre in there thats just the way it is until they pay their crime and then they get out and hopefully dont ever go back Fritts says. But this whole thing has made me kind of realize that the prison system is broken. It just doesnt seem to work.
Until recently fatal overdoses in Tennessee prisons were rare. There were no confirmed drug toxicity deaths in 2017 according to the Department of Correction. But in the last two years at least 68 people have died from drugs not including deaths with pending autopsies. There were even more close calls during that period. Staff administered overdose-reversal drugs almost 900 times.
The spike in overdoses follows a national trend  both behind bars and beyond them. But Wanda Bertram from the Prison Policy Initiative says incarcerated people face an especially high risk.
Prisons are very isolating places she says.
During much of the pandemic Bertram notes in-person visitation was halted in prisons. People were not able to see their families for months as outbreaks of the contagious virus tore through penitentiaries where people live in close quarters. Outside volunteers were also barred for many months.
Bertram says regular exposure to violence also takes a toll on peoples mental health. Plus it can be hard to get medical care.
Dr. Homer Venters an expert on correctional health told WPLN News last year that prison health care systems were struggling to keep up before the pandemic. He said COVID-19 has further limited access to medical treatment.
You might turn to drugs to self-medicate Bertram says.
Its a daily battle
Addiction affects about two thirds of people in U.S. prisons according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Pair that with the growing presence of fentanyl and youve got a dangerous situation. That drug can be up to 50 times stronger than heroin.
But one of the most proven therapies for addiction Medication-Assisted Treatment is nearly impossible to access in Tennessee prisons. The Department of Correction says just five people in its custody are currently receiving MAT which prescribes people medications like Suboxone to curb their cravings. Thats out of about 20000 individuals in prison. Everyone else is stuck with whatever unregulated substances are sneaking inside.
Its a significant issue that we face each and every day outgoing corrections commissioner Tony Parker testified at a state senate corrections subcommittee meeting last fall. He said the department is installing body scanners and checking the perimeters for drugs.
We also have a very aggressive law enforcement division that works both with federal partners state partners and local to mitigate some of the issues that we see with drug interdiction Parker said. But chairman its an ongoing battle. Its a daily battle to fight these drugs in our facilities.
Several prison employees have been arrested for bringing in contraband in recent years. TDOC also said in an email that it is working to get more people into treatment including with medication and a new peer program that teaches people how to help one another through recovery.
State-run prisons however are just one piece of the puzzle. Overdoses are also spiking in Tennessees for-profit prisons which are operated by Brentwood-based CoreCivic. The company has its own drug treatment programs including both a nine- to 12-month residential treatment program and outpatient care for less severe cases. A spokesperson also says CoreCivic has a zero-tolerance policy for contraband.
But Jason Carnett says their Trousdale Turner facility was the worst place he could have been sent as someone with a substance use disorder. He was there until last fall and he says drug were all around him.
It breaks the monotony I guess Carnett says.
He says the prison is a haven of depression and anger and paranoia. Drugs he says are an escape.
I probably would have overdosed
Carnett 35 has struggled with drug dependency for most of his life. He says he smoked marijuana for the first time when he was 11. Later he started to steal his parents prescription drugs. At 15 he says he was prescribed painkillers after getting hit by a car. Carnetts addiction kept landing him in jail and prison. During his latest stint behind bars he says he was using drugs just about every day.
Courtesy Jason Carnett
Carnett says he mostly stayed away from fentanyl. But one day he says someone put a pack of it in his hand while he was on the phone.
After Carnett hung up he went back to his cell and opened the paper towel. His hands had sweat so much during the 30 minutes he was on the phone that he says the fentanyl had mostly dissolved.
Carnett got lucky. He says one of his friends overdosed that night.
If it wouldnt have dissolved I probably would have overdosed he says.
Carnett was released in September and says hes now getting meds to treat his addiction along with mental health therapy.
But he wont forget all the overdoses he saw in prison. The stream of stretchers rolling past his cell. Those are seared into his mind.
Im just glad I made it out of there he says.
Nashville Mayor Mourns Son's Overdose Death Urges Families To Talk About Addiction
Enlarge this image toggle caption Tony GonzalezNashville Public Radio Tony GonzalezNashville Public Radio
The epidemic of drug overdose deaths has hit home for the mayor of Nashville Tenn. Her 22-year-old son Max Barry died last month of an overdose near Denver.
And for the first time since tragedy struck her family Mayor Megan Barry spoke publicly Monday to call on families to have frank and difficult conversations about addiction.
I don't want his death to define his life but we have to have a frank conversation about how he died. The reality is that Max overdosed on drugs Barry said. My hope is that it may inspire and encourage other parents out there ... and that if that saves one life what a blessing.
The mayor who resumed her work duties after nine days away described a new normal.
I get to get up every day now and I don't ever get to talk to my son again she said. Max is not going to text me back. I'm not going to hear his voice again.
The mayor's mourning has been as public as can be. Civic leaders and hundreds of everyday citizens turned out to two open memorials where Barry received hugs for hours.
While she didn't speak at the funeral her husband Bruce Barry a Vanderbilt University business professor did.
We all  of all ages  have made incredible mistakes in our lives and we almost always walk away from them. And he made one that you don't walk away from he said. But the point I want to make here is the circumstances ... tell the story of his death and not the story of his life.
Friends and relatives paint Max Barry's life as one of humor and a love of the outdoors which led him to the University of Puget Sound. He graduated in May.
Yet from the moment that his death became public there was no hiding from the fact that an overdose claimed his life. The mayor said paramedics administered Narcan to her son  the anti-overdose medicine  but it didn't save his life.
Jefferson County Colo. where the Barrys' son died saw a 100 percent increase in overdose deaths from 2002 to 2014 according to the Colorado Health Institute. In Nashville first responders have been carrying the antidote as overdose deaths rise. There were 261 overdoses in the city last year prompting the mayor to budget for a new opioid specialist earlier this year. And Mayor Barry said she'll find ways to do even more including using her platform.
If you see another child who is struggling don't ever hesitate to pick up the phone and call that parent she said because parents you know sometimes we don't see everything that's in front of us.
She said her son  her only child  can never be replaced.
But I know that with my faith and with my family and with my friends we will get through this she said. The reality is that I'm back to work. And we have a lot of work to do in Nashville.
NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  The opioid crisis continues to affect communities across the country and researchers are saying its impact has reached new levels.
The use of fentanyl together with stimulants like cocaine and meth is driving what they're calling the Fourth Wave.
The first wave began because of the rise in prescription opioids starting in the early 2000s the second by heroin's rise starting around 2010 and the third fentanyl around 2013.
Now the fourth has become known as more people are mixing together fentanyl with other stimulants knowingly and unknowingly.
The overdose epidemic has taken a heartbreaking toll on Nashville with just one other city in the country having a higher overdose death rate.
Davidson county's total last year 754 deaths made Nashville the second worst place in the country for overdose deaths. Fentanyl was detected in more than 77 percent of the cases.
As of this year 332 people died of an overdose in Nashville in the first half of this year. The county's overdose death count has gotten higher every year since 2016 however If the trend continues this year the numbers may be lower than 2022.
Researchers said understanding how people use drugs is crucial to stopping the overdose crisis and helping people get treatment. Treatments like Narcan are now available over the counter to offer immediate help.
He woke up hazy face plastered against a long aluminum bench looking up at two campus policemen staring back at him.
A hot sun beat down on Neyland Stadium which had emptied out hours earlier after the TennesseeMississippi State game in 1986.
Whered everybody go Loyd slurred.
The officers laughed  until Loyd vomited nearly hitting their shoes.
The policemen loaded him into the back of a golf cart drove him to 1844 Fraternity Park Drive and asked loudly to the other students partying outside Does this belong to you
Everyone laughed even Loyd who 10 minutes later was drunkenly posing for pictures with the policemen.
Loyd knew he was different from most of the other students When he started drinking Loyd couldnt stop until he ran out or passed out. He stopped drinking in medical school.
Today Loyd is a physician and Tennessees assistant commissioner overseeing the substance abuse services department. That makes him the states chief fighter in the war against opioids abuse.
 InvestigationHow many lives are lost to opioids No one knows.
 RelatedOpioid-related hospitalizations more than triple for Tennessee seniors
But the ironic twist  Loyd battled a 100-pain-pills-a-day habit after medical school.
Half of the nights I went to bed I was afraid to close my eyes because I was afraid I would die in my sleep he said. The other half I prayed I would die in my sleep so it would be over.
College got him out of a chaotic home
Loyd grew up on a small farm in East Tennessee in a family of mechanics but he couldnt work a screwdriver or wrench. His family was riddled with mental illness alcoholics and drug addicts.
Home was chaotic so Loyd decided to be the first one in his family to graduate from college where  despite drinking binges  he got good grades.
He went on to medical school at East Tennessee State University.
Becoming a doctor was his ticket out.

Loyd got intimidated by his classmates on the first day.
The students introduced themselves One was a test pilot for a Stealth Bomber another got a masters degree from University of California Berkeley.
Im sitting there going Oh my goodness. I decided I couldnt let them see me drink.
'Everything melted off me'
In that elite group Loyd got elected class president a role he had all four years.
Pressure started to build at the end of his residency. Married with two young children Loyd felt anxiety about his first job.
Driving home after work Loyd stopped at a red light and flipped open his glove box. There they were some old hydrocodone pain pills his dentist had given him weeks earlier for a procedure.
He broke one in half and popped it in his mouth. Within minutes he had a solution to his problems.
It really felt like everything melted off me Loyd said closing his eyes. I can feel it right now.
Days later when he visited his aunt he rifled through her medicine cabinet. He took some of her Loritab pain pills prescribed for a cough.
Im thinking I could take 10 or 11 and shell never miss them. There were probably 60 in there.
Taking pain pills from his patients
Loyd took a pill a day. Each time he visited her he'd take more pills.
Then he started taking them from patients who brought in prescriptions during appointments.
Oh I see youre on the 7.5 milligram pain pills. You probably need to be on 10 milligrams. Ill write you a new prescription and you can leave that giant bottle of 7.5s with me he would say.
Loyd also asked his doctor friends to write him prescriptions.
I was buzzing I was euphoric he said.
Before long Loyd was ingesting about 100 pain pills a day sometimes swallowing them by the handful often grinding them up and snorting them.
One day he dropped off his son Heath with his father so granddad and the boy could go hiking together.
Loyd in his red Ford F150 reached into his cup holder and grabbed 15 Percocet pills and threw them into his mouth.
'Steve you've got a drug problem'
He looked up and his dad was a foot away staring brows creased at Loyd through the trucks window.
Steve did you just take a handful of pills his dad asked.
No.
The next evening his fathers pickup was in his driveway when Loyd got home.
Get in the truck his father insisted.
The two drove to Loyds sisters house and on the way his father asked
Do you have a drug problem
No Dad Im tired. Look how much I work.
Five minutes passed and father put his hand on his sons knee.
Steve youve got a drug problem.
Dad I do. And I cant stop.
Loyd began sobbing.
'I'm Steve Loyd and I'm hurting'
Im gonna lose my wife my family my house and cars.
Steve his father said slowly none of that stuffs gonna do you any good if youre dead.
Within days Loyd went to Vanderbilt hospital to detox and to a 30-day rehab for professionals after that.
At one of his first 12-step meetings Loyd opened his mouth.
Im Steve Loyd and Im hurting.
That was enough to have men and women in recovery surround him and help him.
He has been without alcohol or pain pills for 13 years.
And Loyd brings all that experience to his job.
I know what its like to want to stop and cant. I know what its like to want to die. I know the shame and guilt he said.
However Im driven every day by my own experience to know that people can and do recover when given the proper treatment and aftercare. We will save lives and we will win in the end.
I cant be convinced otherwise.

Sue Goodrum woke up to flashing lights outside her bedroom window after falling asleep early on a winter night in 2016.
Her 33-year-old son Daniel recently paralyzed in a car accident stayed with her at her house in the Frayser neighborhood of Memphis with his girlfriend and their 6-week old son.
A hallway and two closed doors separated Goodrum's room from her son's living space and a fan was blowing to drown out noise. When she saw the ambulance at about 930 p.m. she didn't think that it was coming to her house. But about 15 minutes later a gurney wheeled down her driveway.
I knew then this is Daniel she said. And I jumped up.
Goodrum's son Corey Goodrum known by his nickname Daniel overdosed that night and two people are charged with killing him by unlawfully distributing the heroin.

Amid the growing opioid crisis the case is one of a number of recent prosecutions in Tennessee in which murder charges have been brought against the people suspected of supplying the deadly dose of drugs.
Other states including Delaware Florida Illinois Kansas Louisiana Michigan Minnesota New Hampshire New Jersey North Carolina Oklahoma Pennsylvania Rhode Island Vermont Washington West Virginia Wisconsin and Wyoming also have drug-induced homicide laws according to the Drug Policy Alliance.
Putting the pieces together
Gathering the evidence to bring charges after a person dies of an opioid overdose can be a challenge according to Metro Nashville Police Lt. Carlos Lara who leads narcotics investigations within the department's specialized investigations division.
The investigations require backtracking he said because often overdose victims are found alone.
Now were trying to  start putting the pieces together Lara said. Starting to dig deep to figure out who was the last person with this person do we have any information on who this person contacted to get the drugs.

That effort can run into hurdles erected by silence by others with drug addictions who fear speaking out and getting into trouble he said.
They need to know if you sell something and somebody dies you can be held accountable he said. And you can be held accountable for their death ... Were hoping itll make them think twice about dealing these drugs.
He sees the murder charge as opposed to a drug distribution charge as another way to combat the opioid crisis.
Were trying to get rid of the drugs no matter what. This is another tool we have to fight this epidemic.
Officials reported at least 1451 people died from drug overdoses in Tennessee in 2015 but the true number is unknown and likely higher by the hundreds according to a USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee investigation.
National statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show more than 33000 people died in 2015 from opioids.

That big heart
Sue Goodrum's son was born in Memphis on August 19 1982. Growing up he liked to fish with his brothers  one older and one younger  at Reelfoot Lake in northwest Tennessee about 100 miles north of Memphis.
A big guy at 6 feet 3 inches he loved sports playing football and basketball.
You knew when he came into a room Goodrum said. He loved to talk and he was going to make sure you heard him because he was loud. Always smiling. Always. He could be dead tired from working or whatever and he would be laughing about it and smiling about it. And very sensitive. Sad movies made him cry. This great big teddy bear but a sad movie is going to make him cry.
His Christian faith was important to him and he was not shy about talking to his friends about Jesus Goodrum said. He especially liked to be kind to the elderly and helped a neighbor who lived alone by mowing her lawn. After any argument with his mother he still called every night to say I love you.
He just had that big heart Goodrum said.
In November 2015 he was injured as a passenger in a car accident at Hollywood and Frayser Boulevard in Memphis breaking his neck in four places. He spent two months at Regional Medical Center and five weeks at a rehab facility unable to move below his chest. Eventually he could move one arm and he started to be able to feed himself.
In February 2016 just days after his release he had a doctor's appointment. But his name got overlooked and the ambulance that was supposed to pick him up didn't come Goodrum said. He had run out of all the medications he had been sent home with.
He decided to use that day she said. He told his girlfriend he was in pain and he wanted to use.
When emergency lights awoke her Goodrum asked her son's girlfriend what was going on.
She said Daniel overdosed on heroin.
The only thing I could think of was why didn't you wake me Goodrum said. If he was in pain we could have taken him to the hospital we could have done anything but that. And you have a baby here. Why didn't you wake me
Her response was she was scared she was scared I would get mad.
The girlfriend 28-year-old Haley High and the suspected dealer 30-year-old Jerrico Long are both charged with second-degree murder in his death.
In a previous case in 2013 18-year-old University of Memphis student Sharon Muir died in a heroin overdose. The state alleged that Eric Herbers bought the heroin to celebrate their one-month anniversary. He pleaded in an agreement for a sentence of eight years.
In another Tennessee case Marvin Pookie Foster was convicted in June of federal charges for selling heroin to a man who overdosed.
Cody E. Tettleton was found unresponsive in his pickup truck July 2 2014 in Halls about 45 miles northwest of Jackson. A farmer saw the truck and called authorities. Foster faces a recommended sentence of 25 years with no parole said U.S. Attorney Michael Dunavant.
At least seven other cases are pending in Shelby County involving people charged in overdose deaths.
Bertrand Ross Tuggle Jr. 53 who was born in Virginia and graduated from Auburn University died last year in Memphis from a lethal mix of fentanyl and heroin after a years long struggle with alcohol and prescription pills. He was found in his car in his driveway.
Two men Aaron Lipford 53 and Justin Slepicka 23 were charged with second-degree murder in his death.
Tuggle's mother Barbara Tuggle had heart problems and she died not long after her son.
What happened to him took a toll on her said her son Allen Tuggle.
To him the second-degree murder charge is more than fair.
In my opinion I think it's very fair and honestly I don't think it's steep enough if you ask me he said. In my opinion it should be life.
In Sumner County northeast of Nashville District Attorney Ray Whitley estimated several such cases had been prosecuted in recent years.
The law has been on the books more than a decade he said but the cases can be tricky because law enforcement must prove how someone got the deadly drugs.
A conviction of second-degree murder carries a possible prison term of 15 to 25 years with no chance at early release he said. He believes that consequence is appropriate for the crime.
Anything we can do to try and deter people from dispensing and using opioids we need to do he said. This is a tool we have and we ought to use it when we have the opportunity.
He believes prosecuting such crimes serves as a deterrent against drug distribution.
Is it effective
The Drug Policy Alliance which opposes the war on drugs and supports a new approach grounded in science compassion health and human rights said most laws charging murder for overdose deaths were passed in the 1980s and were reinvigorated in the wake of increasing overdose deaths in the last few years.
There is absolutely no evidence in support of the effectiveness of these laws for either reducing sales or use or reducing overdoses said Drug Policy Alliance senior staff attorney Lindsay LaSalle.
MoreTales of opioid anguish and a search for answers at Southaven town hall
OpinionWe all have role to play in ending opioid crisis
Instead the policy group argues that such laws actually discourage people from making 911 calls for overdose victims for fear of prosecution.
On the other hand proven strategies are available to reduce the harms associated with drug misuse treat dependence and addiction improve immediate overdose responses enhance public safety and prevent fatalities the group said in a paper.
These strategies include expanding access to the lifesaving medicine naloxone and its associated training improving fact-based drug education for young people that includes an overdose prevention and response component enacting legal protections that encourage people to call for help for overdose victims training people how to prevent recognize and respond to an overdose increasing access to medication-assisted treatment including methadone and buprenorphine and implementing safe injection facilities.
In shock
Daniel Goodrum had previously struggled with addiction. At some point  his mom thinks in high school he started drinking and when he got older he developed a problem with pain pills. When they got too expensive he turned to heroin Sue Goodrum said.
The night of the overdose a detective came separating Goodrum and her husband from the girlfriend. The detective told Goodrum he was sorry. Her son didn't survive.
I can just still hear those words Goodrum said. You know they ring in your head. 'I'm sorry your son didn't make it.'
She went outside her house and started hitting the walls of the ramp that had been built for her son after his accident.
She was in shock.
But you have to hold yourself together she said. So that's what you do.

Listen
The big hospital chains based in Nashville are accepting some of the blame for the countrys opioid crisis which grows more deadly by the year. They admit they were going overboard with opioids to make people as pain-free as possible. So in an effort to be part of the cure theyre issuing an uncomfortable warning to patients  youre going to feel some pain.
Even for those whove never struggled with drug abuse
studies are finding that patients are at risk of addiction
anytime they go under the knife.
I had the c-section had the kiddo says Michelle Leavy of Las Vegas. And then they tell me its ok you can keep taking the pain medications its fine.'
Leavy is a mother of three and a paramedic who has dealt with many addicts herself. She welcomed the high-dose intravenous narcotics while she was in the hospital. And as she went home she gladly followed doctors orders and kept ahead of the pain with her Percocet pills.
But then she needed stronger doses. And pretty soon she realized she was no longer treating pain.
Before I went to work I took them and to get the kids after school I had to take them she says. Then I was taking them just to go to bed. I didnt really realize I had a problem until the problem was something more than I could have taken care of myself.
She was becoming like the addicts she transported by ambulance lying to emergency room doctors to con a few extra doses.
Pretty soon she lost her job and her fiancé before going to rehab through Nashville-based American Addiction Centers and stitching her life back together.
A 180 On Opioids
Its a reality that has been completely disconnected from where it often starts  in a hospital. Anesthesiologist David Alfery in Nashville says he was rarely stingy with opioids.
If I could awaken them without any pain whatsoever I was the slickest guy on the block and it was a matter of enormous pride he says.
Alferys part of a working group at the Nashville-based consulting firm Health Trust where hospitals have set aside some of their competitive interests to swap ideas.
It starts with patient expectations and I think over the years patients have come to expect more and more in terms of I dont want any pain after surgery and its an unrealistic expectation Alfery says.
That expectation exists in part because pain treatment was institutionalized. Hospitals
have been graded on how well they keep someones pain at bay. And doctors can feel some pressure.
I just wanted my patient not to be in pain thinking I was doing the right thing for them and certainly not an outlier among my colleagues says Mike Schlosser chief medical officer for HCAs national group of hospitals.
Schlosser spent a decade as a spinal surgeon putting his patients at HCAs flagship facility Centennial Medical Center through some of the most painful procedures in medicine like correcting back curvature. He says he genuinely just wanted to soothe the hurt he caused.
But now looking back on it I was putting them at significant risk for developing an addiction to those medications he says.
Looking at company-wide data for the largest for-profit hospital chain in the country hes found that for orthopedic and back surgeries the greatest risk isnt infection or some other complication  its addiction.
So HCA is rolling out a new protocol prior to surgery. It includes a conversation Schlosser basically never had when he was practicing medicine.
We will treat the pain but you should expect that youre going to have some pain. And you should also understand that taking a narcotic so that you have no pain really puts you at risk of becoming addicted to that narcotic Schlosser tells patients.
Besides issuing the uncomfortable warning limiting opioids also takes more work on the hospitals part  trying nerve blocks and finding the most effective blend of non-narcotics. Then after surgery the nursing staff has to stick to it. If someone can get up and walk and cough without doubling over maybe they dont need narcotics.

Of course business-wise no one wants to be the hospital where it hurts more.
You dont want to portray the fact that youre not going to treat people appropriately says John Young national medical director of cardiovascular services for LifePoint Hospitals. The Brentwood-based hospital chain is putting special emphasis on how it handles people coming into the ER looking for pain medicine.
Young says tightening up on opioids is a delicate matter but its the right thing to do.
We really do have a lot of responsibility and culpability and this burden and so we have to make sure we do whatever we can to stem this tide and turn the ship in the other direction he says.
While hospitals get their ship in order some patients are taking personal responsibility.
Now that shes in recovery Michelle Leavy wont touch opioids. That meant she had emergency gallbladder surgery in 2017 without any narcotics. She says it can be done.
I mean it hurt she says. But I lived.
Pain pills are sending more senior citizens to the hospital in Tennessee according to data that sheds new light on how opioid addiction has spread to the state's aging population.
The rate of hospitalizations for Tennesseans 65 years and older due to painkillers has more than tripled in a decade.
Older adults are being hospitalized for reasons that range from falls and auto accidents after taking pain pills to unintentional overdoses interactions with other medications and weakened kidney or liver functions in aging bodies that fail to metabolize the drug in the same way as younger people.
Beyond pills Treating pain without opioids
Experts say physicians and family members are more likely to overlook addiction in senior citizens  even after opioids require a trip to the hospital.
It's not that easy to believe your grandmother has a drug abuse problem said Dr. Peter Martin a psychiatrist and director of the Vanderbilt Addiction Center.
The biggest problem is that no one in the past was worried about an elderly person becoming an addict Martin said.
But opioids affect the brain no matter how old you are. If a person in their 60s and 70s is running out of their prescription early most physicians are less likely to look on that with suspicion as they might do with a younger person he said. They're thinking 'Oh they probably forgot it somewhere.' 
The U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality data ranks Tennessee No. 6 in the nation for the rates of opioid-related hospital admissions among senior citizens. In 2005 467 out of every 100000 people aged 65 and older spent time in the hospital for opioid-related use. In 2015 that rate shot up to 1505.
Tennessee is grappling with an epidemic that claims more lives than car accidents straining courts jails and hospitals and exhausting the limited treatment options. Tennessee along with Alabama tops the nation in the number of per-person opioid prescriptions with an average of more than two prescriptions written for every man woman and child.
In his Nashville practice gerontologist Dr. Jim Powers addresses the problem where it typically starts  in the exam room.
The conversations can be awkward when patients have regularly taken opioids for legitimate pain.
Some patients began taking opioids a decade or more ago when they were in their 40s and 50s and suffered back pain or arthritis at a time when opioids were considered the first line of pain treatment he said. They never stopped.
It's a difficult conversation to have when you're a physician and seeing a new patient Powers said. Most physicians have to negotiate and say 'We'll continue this but let's try other things. Let's get an X-ray.' About 90 percent of physicians will continue opioid prescriptions although they have misgivings.
Powers works with those patients over time to introduce alternatives  physical therapy or spinal injections of cortisone. About a third of his patients are eventually willing to try to stop taking opioids he said.
Other patients need professional help. They need tapering he said. But the system is not ready to receive as many older patients with substance abuse disorder. As the population has grown older we have not seen a corresponding increase in drug treatment programs.
Federal data shows that seniors continue to be more likely to be prescribed opioids.
One-third of seniors enrolled in Medicare Part D prescription coverage filled at least one prescription for an opioid last year  about 14.4 million people according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
More than half a million of those beneficiaries received higher-than-average opioid dosages for at least three months.
Federal and Medicare data doesn't make distinctions between people in their 60s and 70s and those who are in their 80s or 90s.
Experts say it's more likely that baby boomers on the younger end of that spectrum are using  and in some cases abusing  opioids.
There's a definite difference between baby boomers and the generation above them who lived through the Great Depression and are in their 80s and 90s and are much more likely to say 'I don't want to be on a pill'  Powers said.
Baby boomers are also more likely to have experience with drugs and alcohol perhaps making them more likely to turn to pain medications Martin said.
The huge spike in opioid-related hospitalizations left some advocates who work with seniors puzzled.
Could a key to the problem not be opioids themselves but the way they're prescribed to seniors who are known to respond to medications differently
We know that as America grows older there's going to be more hip replacements or more falls but I don't think that counts for a nearly fourfold increase in opioid hospitalizations for this group said Grace Sutherland Smith executive director for the Council on Aging of Middle Tennessee.
We have to ask whether doctors are taking into account how someone over 65 metabolizes medications differently than a young person she said. Whereas you and I might be able to work an older person might become sleepy or numb or incoherent.
Seniors who do seek addiction treatment may face challenges in finding and paying for it.
Medicare covers inpatient detoxification partial hospitalization residential treatment and outpatient individual and group therapy according to information provided by BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee.
It does not cover intensive outpatient treatment or medication-assisted treatment for addiction. The latter can be a key treatment for opioid addicts substituting a maintenance drug that allows people to abstain from opioids.
But there are signs that more older individuals want help.
At a Nashville admissions center for Foundations Recovery Network a nationwide network of treatment facilities for mental health and addiction there was a 55 percent increase in calls from people in the 65-plus age group seeking treatment between January 2015 and January 2017.
Many people assume that addiction is impacting only young people said Lee Pepper chief marketing officer at Foundations Recovery Network. As our population is living longer and aging we are seeing addiction impact our parents and grandparents. Treatment options for elderly Americans become more difficult due to lack of access because of medical complications and mobility.

Nick Salazar didnt think he was an addict because he didnt live on urban city streets.
He lived instead in his parents house in suburban New Jersey.
I thought I have a job so Im OK. Im not homeless so Im OK  recalled Salazar.
He didnt think he was an addict because he took prescription pills not heroin.
Then one day he took heroin because he was short on the cash to buy pills.
It was only going to be a one-time fix and then he would go back to pills  because that was better somehow.
But it wasnt for one day. Heroin was cheaper.
I thought Im not shooting it. I snort it or smoke it. Again that told me I wasnt a drug addict he said.
I had this idea I grew up in this upper-middle class suburb in New Jersey. I grew up with this idea of what an addict was and where an addict was and that did not fit with what I saw in my town.
Addicts are in almost every town in Tennessee and the U.S. At least 1263 people died from overdose in the state in 2014.
Yet it wasnt until Salazar now 26 moved from Summit N.J. to Nashville to get help at Cumberland Heights that he realized he wasnt alone and that an addict can be anyone anywhere.
Overdose deaths reach 'epidemic proportions'
What Ive seen more and more talking to my friends is addicts are everywhere he said. Opiates and heroin are everywhere.
Salazar has been clean for three-and-a-half years. He made a group of friends most of whom are recovering from substance abuse and decided to stay in Nashville.
He married this summer and expects to graduate from Belmont University in three semesters. Hes passionate about substance abuse and helps others who are in rehab.
There are people all across the state with experiences such as his.
He started with Vicodin and Percocet from people who had wisdom teeth removed or were being treated for sports injuries.
Article continues below photo.
Then he moved to Oxycontin. At his peak of tolerance he spent about 200 a day to get his fix.
Heroin  used in the late 19th century as a cough suppressant and ironically as a treatment to opioid addiction  was next.
I had this idea this stigma in my mind about using it it was a line I didnt want to cross Salazar said. I had in my mind that pills were somehow safe and better because they were from a doctor not my doctor but a doctor.
Heroin was a step too far until it wasn't. He spent about 100 a day at his peak of heroin use.
The addiction took over his life. He woke up thinking about his next fix.
It became more important to me than anything else Salazar said.
He tried to get clean. Sometimes he took less. He never had a close call with an overdose but he felt resigned to his life and at times almost wanted to take too much.
Now he wants to write and direct TV shows and movies. He thinks about recovery every day but not the drugs and addiction.
In the early days of treatment using was an obsession.
Recovery is something I work on every day he said. I really wanted to get clean more than I wanted to get high so I did things to treat that disease.

When he spotted his 11-month-old daughter she had white residue on her lips.
She was having difficulty breathing  her body battling a mixture of cocaine and fentanyl  close to becoming one of the youngest overdose victims in Nashville.
The child was treated at Centennial Medical Center's Children's Hospital. She is expected to make a full recovery.
Dozens arent so lucky.
Fatal drug overdoses in Nashville declined during the first quarter of 2023 but still netted 93 confirmed deaths with 49 pending. During the first three months of 2022 officials counted 193 fatal overdose deaths.
Related emergency room visits dropped slightly during the same period  from 525 2022 to 499 2023. Also three out of four overdose-related toxicology reports during the first quarter of 2023 contained fentanyl.
1999-2021 Child deaths nationally from fentanyl increased
Nationally the picture is more grim. One recent study published in JAMA Pediatrics found that child deaths from fentanyl increased sharply between 1999 and 2021. Fifteen years ago 5 of opioid deaths in children were caused by fentanyl according to the study. By 2021 fentanyl was responsible for 94 of such deaths that study found.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reported earlier this year that overdose deaths from fentanyl jumped 279 from 2016 to 2021.
How Nashville is getting serious about overdose deaths
The medical emergency in Nashville came to the attention of local authorities when the father informed them that his daughter pulled a piece of paper from a bathroom garbage can and placed it in her mouth. He initially denied responsibility for the fentanyl then later admitted to purchasing the illegal narcotics and discarding them in the home.
Officers located a straw on a living room table and a lottery ticket with a white powdery substance still on it.
Officials notified the Department of Childrens Services which provided services to the childs mother she was not present at the time her daughter ingested the fentanyl. This investigation is ongoing.
This case and others explain why Nashville is getting serious about curbing overdose deaths especially along Lower Broadway where 30 bars including Whiskey Row and Frank Sinatra Lounge now store Naloxone also known as Narcan an opioid reversal medication on-site.
Also Gibson Gives a charitable organization under Gibson Guitars launched TEMPO Training and Empowering Musicians to Prevent Overdoses. The program places the kits which cost around 350 in Nashville music venues.

Outgoing Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery recently claimed victory in a 450 million national settlement with Ireland-based drugmaker Endo International yet five years ago he tried to derail legal efforts in Northeast Tennessee that led to a 35 million settlement thats netting more money for nine counties than his Endo deal brought for the entire state.
The settlement negotiated by district attorneys general and their outside counsel also went directly to local governments for opioid abuse prevention and treatment.
From the outset the district attorneys used an aggressive approach and its outside counsel prepared to go to trial taking 50 to 60 depositions causing Endo to refuse to cooperate according to Sullivan County District Attorney Barry Staubus.
And I dont think the attorney general I dont think their offices mindset was the same Staubus says.
Dubbed Sullivan Baby Doe for a child born addicted to opioids the 2.4 billion lawsuits outcome netted proceeds for the babys care and 21 million for nine counties in Northeast Tennessee after Sullivan County Chancellor E.G. Moody found Endo egregiously refused to share information necessary for the plaintiffs to prepare for trial.
In comparison the entire state of Tennessee could get an estimated 7.1 million to 11.7 million  depending on when its paid  from the most recent national settlement with Endo negotiated by the Tennessee Attorney Generals Office which led 30 states and the District of Columbia in reaching the deal.
A group of district attorneys general in Northeast Tennessee partnered with the Nashville law firm of Branstetter Stranch  Jennings to pursue a lawsuit against opioid manufacturers despite opposition to their suit from Attorney General Herbert Slatery  and won 35 million.
With Endo filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy the amount could be further muddied and ultimately part of the final award would go to the state government potentially leaving even less for counties and cities in East and Middle Tennessee to divvy up for opioid addiction treatment or services.
According to a default judgment ordered by Moody the plaintiffs introduced enough expert testimony to support their 2.4 billion claim for damages against the drug maker which it proved knew too many opioids were flooding the market. Endos own records show that 75 of abuse of a reformulated type of Opana ER that some people were injecting took place in Tennessee as the company aggressively marketed opioids to prescribers according to the document.
But as the group of DAs pursued the case with Nashville-based Branstetter Stranch  Jennings the Attorney Generals Office tried to assert its authority and take them all out of the equation.
According to spokeswoman Samantha Fisher the Attorney Generals Office intervened to defend the constitutionality of the statute which we do whenever statutes are challenged.
She notes the East Tennessee district attorneys pursued the Drug Dealer Liability Act which was a different strategy than the Attorney Generals Office took in its case. Fisher adds that the states case is likely to be dismissed because of the bankruptcy but that the proposed settlement would allow Tennessee and other states and local governments to recover millions for abatement.
Slatery however who left office Wednesday Aug. 31 after his term ended clearly objected to the use of trial attorneys.
In an op-ed published this week in the Memphis Commercial Appeal Slatery wrote that the Tennessee Attorney Generals Office refuses to use private-contingency fee lawyers in opioid cases contending theyve received millions of dollars in legal fees.
He does acknowledge in the op-ed that the state hired outside counsel in a lawsuit against Walgreens but paid it for hourly fees billed at a reduced rate. To use an outside law firm the attorney general must have the governors approval as well as the eyes of the governor secretary of state and attorney general on the fee invoices he wrote.
A spokesperson for Slatery said the Attorney Generals office intervened in the DAs suit to defend the constitutionality of the statute which we do whenever statutes are challenged.
Its not clear whether the philosophy of the Attorney Generals Office will change.
Slaterys replacement Jonathan Skrmetti his chief deputy attorney general from 2018 to 2021 managed 160 attorneys and served as a negotiator in a 26 billion multi-state opioid settlement. Hes been Gov. Bill Lees chief counsel since December 2021.
Skrmetti was on staff through much of the Baby Doe case as Slatery tried to take over the case.
However district attorneys  representing local governments who filed suit against Endo and other major pharmaceutical companies in 2017  argued that their strategy would net more money from industry enabling local governments to provide more services to battle the opioid crisis.
Led by Staubus DAs in Northeast Tennessee fended off the effort by Slatery to scuttle the lawsuit they filed against pharmaceutical giants that led to the 35 million settlement in 2021.
The group of DAs felt they were in the best position to take on the case and win the biggest award according to Staubus money that wouldnt have to go through Nashville and could directly target the regions opioid problem which was substantial.
From 2006 through 2014 more than 416 million pain pills were supplied to the nine-county area in Northeast Tennessee 138.4 million to Sullivan County alone 76.1 million to Washington County and 74.7 million to Hamblen County.
After four years of litigation and bankruptcies by Purdue Pharma and Mallinckrodt PLC  the latter of which manufactures and distributes the opioid Roxycodone  the DAs won a settlement with Endo in Sullivan Baby Doe originally Staubus vs. Purdue.
Once legal fees and the court-sealed amount set aside for Baby Doe were distributed local governments in three Northeast Tennessee received the 21 million much of which they are planning to use to outfit an opioid treatment center at a former state prison in Carter County. The Washington County Commission this week approved using 1.9 million for the facility where people addicted to opioids could seek treatment rehabilitation vocational and job training and help in finding jobs and possibly reconnecting with families. Other funds are going toward drug recovery courts.
Staubus stands by the decision to take on the pharmaceutical industry without the Attorney Generals Office saying they are vindicated by the settlement amounts.
I felt like we could get more money because we were focused. We had a game plan that was far more aggressive and I felt like we had excellent attorneys leading the charge Staubus says.
Staubus and District Attorneys Dan Armstrong and Ken Baldwin from Northeast Tennessee championed the case and led by the Nashville-based law firm obtained the settlement when the chancellor determined that Endo defaulted by not sharing information pertinent for trial.
Endo didnt want to produce documents showing its sales force and managers hedged on the illicit diversion of opioids by pill mills and other prescribers. It finally provided 400000 pages of proof after a court-ordered deadline of Feb. 14 2020 for presenting evidence.
In short the chancellor found Endo in contempt and determined the company lost the case before it could go to trial and the only decision was to set the damages forcing the drug producer to settle.
The district attorneys took the money  much of which went straight to local governments with no strings attached  before Endo could file bankruptcy.
Staubus an appointee of former Gov. Bill Haslam who since won election to the post stops short of criticizing Slatery pointing out only that the Attorney Generals Office felt it had the jurisdiction and was in the best position to lead the litigation and decide where the money would go.
As prosecutors however Staubus says we were in the best position to understand what the drug problem was and what the needs were and we just didnt think we needed to beg Nashville to give us money. And we felt like we could be just as effective in our negotiations or our litigation as they were in obtaining that money.
Staubus also says his fight with Endo wouldnt have been successful without outside counsel because of the complexity and enormity of the case.
Slatery however makes no effort to hide his opposition to the use of private law firms to do battle with the pharmaceutical industry.
He further defended his office in the op-ed noting the state has had 15 to 18 attorneys working on opioid cases since 2016. As a result millions of dollars are coming into an Opioid Abatement Trust Fund to be distributed by an independent council to counties and cities.
In that vein Slatery wanted to wrench the Baby Doe case from the DAs and Branstetter Stranch  Jennings a private-contingency firm. But he might not have been prepared to take on the case at that point. He withdrew a motion to intervene a day after the outside law firm responded.
Gerard Stranch partner with Branstetter Stranch  Jennings says Northeast Tennessee district attorneys won out for a simple reason.
We got a better deal because we worked our case all the way up to trial and if they didnt pay us the money we wanted they were going to have to go through a trial Stranch says. We invited the state in to negotiate with us against Endo and they declined.
Democratic state Sen. Jeff Yarbro a Nashville attorney takes a cautious approach to Slaterys work on global opioid settlements.
Tennessee would have fared better if the Attorney General had coordinated his efforts with the district attorneys and local governments rather than try to control them Yarbro says. Concentrating the negotiation and settlement of thousands of claims in a single person is a high-risk strategy that can lead to settling claims for a fraction of their value and insufficient accountability for wrong-doers.
Genesis of dissent
District attorneys general from 14 districts signed a letter to Slatery in March 2018 declaring their opposition to his efforts to derail their lawsuit part of which was based on their decision to use outside counsel.
We find it troubling that you are taking a position adverse to our goals in this litigation. As we have stated to you many many times before we are hopeful that you would be an asset in our fight against the drug producers who drown our communities in illegal opioids. We are disappointed in your attempts to undermine our litigation the letter states.
In fact Staubus says in hindsight he wishes the DAs had been able to team up with the Attorney Generals Office but that never worked out.
The group of district attorneys also noted they were disappointed the state filed motions to intervene in each of their pending lawsuits and contacted each court to schedule unnecessarily expedited hearings without notifying them or their counsel.
The DAs felt those actions by Slaterys office were calculated to prejudice us in the pending lawsuits and provoke rather than lead to reasonable dialogue.
The limited monies that were received went into state coffers in Nashville not into the hands of the smaller communities bearing the greatest need. The results of this failed effort have been another decade lost to growing opioid-fueled abuse addiction and death.  A letter to Attorney General Herbert Slatery signed by 14 district attorneys general
Furthermore in the pending motions and in your recent communications with our attorneys your office refuses to state why it is seeking to intervene and will not confirm or deny whether the purpose of intervening will be to scuttle our lawsuits without any further discovery into the nature and scope of human devastation and economic toll that the major drug producers pill mills and others have wrought on the communities that we serve the letter states.
In arguing the attorney general was overstepping his authority the district attorneys also said Slaterys claim that they were unauthorized to hire outside counsel was without merit. They pointed out the costs of the lawsuit were borne by the outside law firm not taxpayers.
The district attorneys also contended Slaterys office was not in the best position  to obtain the best possible monetary recovery for communities. It pointed out a 2 billion annual cost of the opioid crisis included 46 million for babies with birth defects and 422.5 million for hospitalizations from opioid abuse.
Damages from the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act are dwarfed by those from the Drug Dealer Liability Act under which the state didnt have authority to file a claim the district attorneys argued. Those included policing prosecutions jails hospital stays rehabilitation centers medical expenses and educational services for those addicted to opioids including babies.
We need those remedies to save our communities not statutory damages put into the state common fund that never make it back to our hometowns the district attorneys letter says.
Furthermore they pointed toward a 2007 settlement by 27 state attorney generals with Purdue Pharma for 19.5 million which netted 400000 in attorney fees for the Tennessee Attorney Generals Office 175750 for the states general fund and only 143750 for consumer education projects to pay for further investigations or litigation at the discretion of the AGs Office.
Tennessee also entered a 10-year agreement requiring Purdue and the state to monitor and enforce suspected diversion of Oxycontin in Tennessee but despite holding the enforcement authority the Attorney Generals Office failed to follow through and Tennessee settled the claims for pennies on the dollar the letter says
The limited monies that were received went into state coffers in Nashville not into the hands of the smaller communities bearing the greatest need the DAs said. The results of this failed effort have been another decade lost to growing opioid-fueled abuse addiction and death.
NASHVILLE Tenn.The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services TDMHSAS applauds the Food and Drug Administration decision to make the opioid overdose reversal drug Narcan available without a prescription. Tennessee has had a statewide collaborative pharmacy practice agreement in place since 2016 allowing pharmacists to dispense naloxone to customers without a conventional prescription but this decision at the federal level will expand the availability of the life-saving medication even further.
While the ruling will take some time to implement the departments long-standing and highly successful training education and naloxone distribution program is still in effect. TDMHSAS has trained Tennesseans on how to recognize and respond to an overdose including the use of naloxone since October 2017 through its Regional Overdose Prevention Specialist ROPS program. In addition ROPS have provided Narcan and other forms of naloxone the opioid overdose antidote to high-risk individuals law enforcement and community agencies. In that time the ROPS have distributed more than 450000 units of naloxone resulting in more than 60000 reported lives saved.
What weve seen with our ROPS and what we know through our community partners is that naloxone saves lives and more naloxone in the hands of Tennesseans at risk of overdose and those who love them is a good thing said TDMHSAS Commissioner Marie Williams LCSW. Were excited about the interest around naloxone and reversing an overdose and we want people to continue to lean on our ROPS for training and naloxone if needed.
NASHVILLE Tenn.  Multiple deadly drug overdoses have occurred in Nashville in the last 24 hours.
The Metro Public Health Department issued an overdose spike alert Saturday afternoon after they said three deadly overdoses overnight involved a white powder in the Hermitage area.
On Saturday night the Nashville Fire Department responded to two overdoses one in Donelson and Old Hickory areas that resulted in the patients being sent to the hospital.
Residents are being urged to check in on loved ones and call 911 in case of a possible overdose. Drug users are also being advised not to use alone.
Those seeking treatment for drug addiction can contact the Community Overdose Response Team can help at 615-687-1701. for more resources.
Tennessees outgoing chief addiction expert said the only way to make a real dent in overdose deaths is the controversial practice of using opioids to reduce cravings.
If you truly want to make an impact you have to embrace that practice said Dr. Stephen Loyd who resigned effective Monday from his job as medical director for the states substance abuse services division.
Loyd 50 left his job to accept the role of co-medical director at a private drug rehab center JourneyPure at the River in Murfreesboro.
Loyd did so after working for the state for two years making hundreds of presentations across Tennessee on drug addiction and serving as an advisor on Gov. Bill Haslams new 30 million plan to battle the opioid epidemic. Most of the money would be used for addiction treatment with some going toward more law enforcement and prevention efforts.
At least 1631 Tennesseans died from drug overdoses  most of those from pain pills called opioids  in 2016 a 12 percent jump from 2015 according to the Tennessee Department of Health.
Loyd said Haslams plan to battle the opioid epidemic is a very good start.
Is it enough he added. No.
Loyd  himself a recovering addict  said medical professionals need to embrace the practice of using opioids like Buprenorphine Sub Oxone and methadone to get addicts off drugs like heroin and Oxycodone.
Any opioid however has a significant chance for abuse making their use controversial in the recovery community.
 More Loyd former pill abuser now battles drug epidemic in Tennessee
 More Governor unveils 30 million plan to battle TN opioid crisis
Loyd and several other Tennessee addiction specialists agree the best approach to recovery is inpatient rehab treatment followed by outpatient monitoring and support groups.
But Loyd and two other experts  Vanderbilt medical school Professor Dan Lonergan and Cumberland Heights chief medical officer Chapman Sledge  also agree residential treatment is too expensive for or otherwise not accessible to most addicts who need it.
So Lonergan said he agrees 100 percent with Loyd that doctors and public health officials should embrace using Buprenorphine and other drugs to wean addicts off their drugs of choice.
Lonergan also said studies have shown medication-assisted treatment is more effective than abstinence-based programs.
In a statement issued Wednesday Feb. 7 the state Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services indicated Tennessee would be open to the use of Sub Oxone and methadone.
We know that no single method of treatment works for all patients with substance use disorder Commissioner Marie Williams said in the statement but we believe that if properly prescribed administered and monitored harm reduction drugs can be effective in helping some patients overcome their addiction issues.
Sledge from Cumberland Heights isnt as quick to embrace using opioids for recovery. He said he has been having good results with an opioid-blocking drug called naltrexone found in the Vivitrol injections some recovering addicts get to keep them from using.
Loyd said the main reason he switched jobs was to get back to directly treating patients.
His new boss said JourneyPure is open to all approaches and to matching patients with best treatment for their individual needs. Right now JourneyPure offers abstinence-based treatment at four residential facilities across the state.
JourneyPure is based on innovation and research said Sam MacMaster co-founder and chief clinical officer for the Nashville-based company. We are open to matching individuals with the best possible service to help end this epidemic and overdose deaths.
The company now uses Vivitrol for some residential patients. JourneyPure provides medication-assisted recovery including using Sub Oxone in some outpatient clinics.

Last year was the deadliest ever for drug overdoses in Tennessee.
The CDC tallied 1837 confirmed deaths plus 89 estimated more deaths.
Deaths dropped in neighboring states that were hit hard by the opioid crisis.
Last year was the deadliest ever for drug deaths in Tennessee and while most of the nation appears to have gained ground on the opioid crisis the Volunteer State has not.
According to new statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at least 1837 people died of drug overdoses in Tennessee in 2018. The CDC estimates that an additional 89 people also died of drug overdoses but those deaths remain unconfirmed by toxicology tests.
Even excluding the estimated deaths the 2018 death toll is an increase of 3 over 2017 which was previously the deadliest year on record.
The CDC data released this week does not reveal what drugs caused each overdose but state experts believe Tennessees increase is largely attributable to rising fentanyl and methamphetamine deaths. State epidemiologist Dr. Tim Jones said the state had made significant progress cutting down on prescription opioid abuse but these gains had been outweighed by fentanyl and meth overdoses.
We were once close to the top of the pile in terms of prescription opioid use abuse and therefore deaths Jones said. Unfortunately as weve decreased opioid prescriptions there are still people who are really dependent and it can drive to heroin fentanyl and other drugs.
SMUGGLINGAs cartel drugs flood Tennessee meth and cocaine deaths are climbing
But that doesnt explain why Tennessee is an outlier in a nation that appears to be gaining ground on the opioid crisis. The CDC reports that nationwide overdoses fell more than 4 in 2018. Overdose deaths dropped more dramatically in other Appalachian states that were among those hit hardest by the epidemic  including Ohio Pennsylvania West Virginia and Kentucky.
Jones said it was unclear why neighboring states had turned a corner when Tennessee had not. Within the Department of Health it remains a frustrating mystery he said.
We will take any good ideas from anywhere as to how to help stop this Jones said.
DRUG DEATHSCocaine heroin increasingly laced with deadly fentanyl drug tests reveal
The new CDC data was also very concerning to Dr. Howard Taylor lab director for American Addiction Centers in Brentwood which tests drug samples collected nationwide. Taylor said one of the strongest indicators for overdose deaths was the availability and quality of addiction treatment so he questioned if shortcomings in treatment were holding Tennessee back.
My concern is that Tennessee is falling behind our neighbors and the rest of the country in terms of what we are offering people for treatment Taylor said.

NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  2388 people died from an opioid overdose in Tennessee in 2020 the last year the Department of Health has numbers available.
Now Tennessee is working to fight the opioid crisis with new funding for treatment programs and prevention.
Nearly 81 million will be given to organizations across the state to combat the opioid epidemic.
In Nashville Meharry Medical College is one of them receiving more than 2 million for four programs. Metro government Nashville CARES and Interfaith Dental Clinic of Nashville are also on the list for grants.
In all Tennessee's Opioid Abatement Council approved of 116 grants to go towards six areas
Treatment Recovery and Support Primary Prevention Education and Training Harm Reduction and Research and Evaluation.
This is the first time the committee is releasing community grants like this.
The funding comes from settlements the state has made with opioid producers distributors pharmacies and marketers that was put into the The Opioid Abatement Trust Fund.
Now the wrongs of those companies will turn into positive action for the people who need it most.
Seeing money going into the community is as exciting as it gets for me said Dr. Stephen Loyd chairman of the Opioid Abatement Council. The system of care we're putting in now is what will serve Tennesseans for the next two or three decades. So that is the dream. No matter where you touch this you get the care that's right for you.
The programs funded by these grants will be supported for up to three years.

Tennessee Voices A conversation with Kristen Gilliland on youth and substance abuse
Kristen Gilliland of the Warren Center for Neuroscience Drug Discovery spoke with The Tennessean Opinion and Engagement Director David Plazas.
When a Bearden homeowners association blew the whistle on the high levels of opiates a Food City grocery store pharmacy was shelling out to pill mill patients the companys chief executive officer called it a lie.
When a Knoxville weekly newsmagazine reported the Westwood Homeowners Associations claims and exposed a slew of opiate-related crimes in the same pharmacys parking lot  as well as its ties to a Bearden pill mill  Food City Chief Executive Officer Steve Smith threatened to pull its advertising from the publications owner.
When the Tennessee Attorney Generals office filed a lawsuit last year chockfull of Food City internal records backing up the associations claims and the Metro Pulse reporting the firm labeled the litigation a smack in the face to grocery store workers everywhere.
Now with a judge refusing the firms bid to have that lawsuit tossed and the records underlying it destroyed Food City is again on the attack branding a laundry list of citizens companies state and federal regulators and leaders equally guilty in fueling the opioid epidemic.
Food City a grocery chain with 2.5 billion in annual sales and 130 stores in Tennessee Virginia and Kentucky is now claiming comparative fault in defense of the states lawsuit records reviewed by the Tennessee Lookout.
The firm argues in its motion that even if the grocery store intentionally sought to profiteer from opioids there are lots of dirty hands in the creation of an epidemic that claims the lives of more than 3000 Tennesseans annually.
For instance the state of Tennessee the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners were informed about the prescribing frequencies of all prescribing physicians and health care providers licensed by the state of Tennessee the motion stated.
Despite the state of Tennessee having records of all opioids being dispensed in Tennessee the state of Tennessee took little to no action to prevent physicians and medical providers from overprescribing opiates the motion stated.
The motion blames federal authorities including the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration for failing to police opioid makers and distributors doctors for overprescribing the addictive painkillers Food Citys competitors for seizing the opportunity to profiteer from overprescribing doctors pill mills for catering to addicts and citizens for abusing the pills.
Each of those groups the firm insisted in the motion should bear blame alongside Food City and pay a share in any damages a jury might assess the grocery chain.
A hearing on that motion and other matters in the states lawsuit against the grocery chain is set for Wednesday in Knox County Circuit Court.
Trappings of legitimacy
The state contends the comparative fault claim is just another example of the grocery chains aggressive tactics to both profiteer from opioid addiction and silence its critics.
The states lawsuit relies upon firms own records including email exchanges between Smith and other corporate officers to detail Food Citys rise from independent grocer catering to rural Appalachian communities to one of the regions biggest grocery chains via those tactics.
One of the ways that Food City has been able to compete against larger market players is with opioids the lawsuit stated. Other considerations aside opioids offer money-making opportunities that other pharmaceutical products do not.
As a medium-sized regional supermarket chain Food City found itself in an apparent sweet spot smaller than major pharmacy chains that attracted attention and resources from the DEA and the Department of Justice but much larger than independent pharmacies which often attracted the attention from local law enforcement.  Lawsuit filed by Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery
On the grocery side of its business Food City exists within an industry that is highly competitive and that operates on tight margins the lawsuit stated. As part of an intentional corporate-driven strategy to maximize profit centers elsewhere Food City zeroed in on opioid sales at its in-store pharmacies and engaged in a series of unlawful acts that led it to become one of the biggest sellers of highly-diverted opioids in Tennessee.
Food City sold opioids by filling prescriptions written by high-volume providers and pill mills that most of its competitors would not sell the lawsuit continued. The company also sold opioids in combinations  labeled the holy trinity of opioids anti-anxiety medication and muscle relaxers  that most of its competitors would not sell and that its own compliance auditors told Food City and its executives were sought by those who illicitly seek pain medications.
Over the last 15 years Food City has sold massive quantities of opioids has continued to fail to maintain effective controls against diversion and has taken affirmative steps to undermine its own opioid diversion controls and those of others the lawsuit stated.
According to records contained in the lawsuit Food City executives partnered with opioid suppliers to fly below the DEAs radar by gaming order thresholds used multiple suppliers to keep the addictive drugs flowing and pushed its pharmacists to fill as many opioid prescriptions as they could.
The firm offered discounts to opiate addicts traded prescriptions for cash partnered with notorious pill-mill operators ignored drug deals and drug-related crimes in pharmacy parking lots and filled opiate prescriptions from other countries and states as far away as Hawaii the lawsuit alleged.
Food City actively partnered with known pill mills that directed their patients to have their prescription filled at Food City  something that its larger competitors would not do or were reluctant to do the lawsuit stated.
As a result of corporate directives that emphasized the profit potential of opioids Food City quickly became known as the pharmacy where you could purchase massive quantities of opioids cheaply and with minimal hassle the lawsuit stated.
Food City used the trappings of legitimacy from its grocery store business in part to become an outlier of outliers even among high-volume opioid sellers the lawsuit continued. As a medium-sized regional supermarket chain Food City found itself in an apparent sweet spot smaller than major pharmacy chains that attracted attention and resources from the DEA and the Department of Justice but much larger than independent pharmacies which often attracted the attention from local law enforcement.
CEO proud of our Food City pharmacies
The lawsuit and Food Citys internal records also lay bare the details surrounding the firms reaction to the first media account of potential problems with the grocery chains relationship with a notorious pill mill in Bearden  then known as Bearden HealthCare Associates  whose owner was later prosecuted federally.
The Westwood Homeowners Association whose residents lived near the Bearden pill mill and the Food City pharmacy that catered to it had complained about both in a monthly newsletter.
According to experts within the Knoxville Police Department Bearden Food City pharmacy dispenses the highest volume of narcotic drugs in the state of Tennessee the newsletter stated. According to eyewitnesses and police reports during the spring of 2008 some pharmacy customers were mugged as they left the store and their prescriptions stolen some at gunpoint. Several shoppers had observed drug deals taking place in the parking lot.
The Metro Pulse which is now shuttered weeks later published an article entitled Drug Zone that confirmed the validity of the claims in the Westwood newsletter and added more claims of wrongdoing by Food City and the Bearden pill mill.
Bearden and Food City both responded forcefully to the Metro Pulse article after its publication the states lawsuit stated. Bearden  filed a libel suit against members of the Westwood Homeowners Association based on the four paragraphs contained in the neighborhood news bulletin. The lawsuit was later dismissed.
Food City CEO Smith penned an open letter he insisted be published in the Metro Pulse in its entirety. In it he called comments from Westwood residents reckless and unfounded.
I cannot let the libelous publication of unsubstantiated rumors go without an appropriate response he wrote. We are all very proud of our Food City pharmacies. Food City Pharmacy associates are truly healthcare professionals  Im at a loss to know how to completely satisfy someone who expresses dislike for any pharmacy operating close to their home because it might attract undesirables as suggested by the resident.
Food City is in the business to serve all Knoxville area customers not judge them Smith said.
According to the lawsuit Smith also threatened to pull future advertising by Food City in the Knoxville News Sentinel which through its parent company E.W. ScrippsCompany owned the Metro Pulse at the time.
The lawsuit and Food Citys internal records reveal Food Citys Bearden pharmacy not only partnered with the Bearden pill mill to fill its suspect prescriptions but threw a party for the clinic to keep its business. The lawsuit also shows Food City quietly settled a wrongful death lawsuit involving dispensing to Bearden pill-mill patients around the same time as the Westwood complaints.
Zombie apocalypse
Emails contained in the lawsuit also show the grocery chains own pharmacists questioned the filling of prescriptions from pill mills and overprescribing doctors  and complained about criminal activity both inside and outside the pharmacies.
In one email a pharmacist at a Food City store in Bristol offered a blunt assessment of what would happen if the grocery chain tightened down on its supply of opiates.
This is phase one of the zombie apocalypse the unidentified pharmacist wrote. Phase two is increased robberies and other violent crimes. Drug addicts move to whatever other drug is available.
The ones who shift to bath salts become temporary zombies super-strong incoherent etc. the pharmacist wrote. If you havent seen bath salt highs watch one or two on YouTube. At this time we thought the movies were fantasy. Get prepared and have a nice day.
A Food City representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesdays hearing and the comparative fault claim.
Food City spokeswoman Tammy Baumgardner has said in a previous statement issued when the states lawsuit was filed last year that the grocery chain is innocent and the lawsuit claims false.
Food City recognized during the relevant time period that a few of its pharmacies dispensed a high volume of pain management prescriptions Baumgardner wrote.
Therefore the company contracted with independent auditors and experts in pharmacy best practices to assure that its dispensing practices were compliant with all state and federal regulations the statement read.
The lawsuit against Food City is the fourth in a chain of legal actions filed by Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery III and his staff against drug makers distributors prescribers and dispensers.
Slatery has said the lawsuits represent an effort to claw back profits from those responsible for Tennessees opioid epidemic to offset what it has cost the state to deal with it. The effort has been spearheaded by Senior Assistant Attorney General Brant Harrell and Assistant Attorneys General Margaret Rowland and Robert Mitchell.
The trio are using the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act and the states public nuisance laws as underpinning and internal records acquired through investigative subpoenas as evidence.
NASHVILLE Tenn. WTVF  So far in 2023 there have been 2864 suspected overdoses in Nashville 217 were deadly. Now a new program is putting lifesaving materials in the hands of those who need it.
The Leave Behind program is a partnership between the Metro Nashville Police Department Metro Nashville Fire Department and STARS or Students Taking A Right Stand.
We are in our very early stages of trying this out in Davidson County said Andrea Hancock Regional Overdose Prevention Specialist with STARS.
As part of the program first responders receive training and overdose reversal kits that they leave behind after responding to an overdose call. The kits include fentanyl test strips sterile gloves Kloxxado a nasal spray that's double the dosage of Naloxone and information on how to find treatment.
It gives the first responders an opportunity also to make a connection and to show that 'hey we're here to help' said Hancock.
Sergeant Michael Hotz with the MNPD Neighborhood Safety Unit said his officers have already distributed between 25 to 35 kits.
A lot of what we do in our unit is outreach and harm reduction said Hotz. We try and put people in touch with treatment resources if they're suffering from substance use disorder.
He said the kits are for those who are at high risk of an opioid overdose or who have recently suffered an overdose.
Just last week Hotz responded to a deadly overdose. There were three individuals left at the scene and we provided them each with kits which not only gives them the lifesaving drug of Naloxone but it also provides them with resources for treatment he said.
Hotz hopes the more kits his officers leave behind the more people will look for treatment.
If we really want to make a difference in this opioid epidemic we need to put people in touch with treatment resources and treat addiction for the disease that it is.
The program is funded by a state overdose response grant through the Tennessee Department of Mental Health  Substance Abuse.
If youre struggling with addiction The Tennessee REDLINE is the 247365 resource for substance abuse treatment referrals.
Anyone can call or text 800-889-9789 for confidential referrals.

Michael Keaton's character in the new Hulu series Dopesick is based in part on the life story of Nashville addiction specialist  and former opioid abuser  Dr. Stephen Loyd.
Keaton plays Dr. Samuel Finnix the caring physician in a small Appalachian mining town  a physician who gets addicted to the pain pills he starts prescribing. Dopesick is a fictionalized version of reporter Beth Macy's book of the same name about the country's opioid crisis and the irresponsible marketing of Purdue Pharma's addictive painkiller OxyContin.
Loyd the former Tennessee opioid epidemic czar himself once abused pain pills taking as many as 100 a day.
Loyd a 54-year-old Knoxville area native got connected with Dopesick producers through Robert Pack a nationally renowned pain pills expert and an associate dean for East Tennessee State University Loyd's medical school alma mater.
Pack is a source for the book Dopesick and author Macy also is a writer for the TV series.
He kept saying You have to interview Dr. Steve He was right Macy said in an email to The Tennessean.
Its Loyd's passion and his knowledge both  hes so very well read about addiction  and then you layer his personal experience on top of it and hes got it all.
Loyd spent several hours on Zoom calls with the TV series' writers one day and Macy sent Loyd follow up questions after that.

The Keaton character is a composite of several doctors we personally know about but Dr. Steve is the one who helped us most directly in the room and afterwards.
Loyd now serves as medical director for Cedar Recovery addiction treatment centers in Middle Tennessee which mostly serves the uninsured or those on public insurance like TENNCare or Medicaid.

A longtime Tennessee doctor who moved to Indiana after five patients died of overdoses in less than a year will spend years in prison on federal drug charges.
Dr. Darrel Rinehart 66 who ran a clinic in Columbia for decades was indicted on 19 counts of distribution of a controlled substance in March 2019.
He was sentenced this week to three years in prison for unlawfully distributing controlled substances according to a news release from the Department of Justice.
At least five of Rineharts patients suffered fatal overdoses that were partially or wholly caused by drugs he prescribed between March 2015 and January 2016 according to public records.

AutopsyTennessee mother died of overdose in home baby son died of starvation dehydration
At least six more of his patients had nonfatal overdoses between 2014 and 2016 and one of those patients overdosed three times state health records showed.
He admitted distributing opioids to four different patients without legitimate medical needs on 18 different occasions between December 2014 and December 2015 the news release indicated.
He also admitted prescribing hydrocodone to a patient without underlying issues in January 2016.
The indictment indicated he routinely prescribed opioids and other drugs without legitimate medical purpose.
A joint investigation by The Tennessean and The Indianapolis Star in 2019 brought the case to the attention of the U.S. Attorney's Office which stepped in to investigate over local prosecutors. Local investigators had used an undercover informant to gain video footage inside Rinehart's clinic.
Before the doctor moved to Indiana the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners agreed to suspend Rineharts medical license if he agreed not to attempt to practice medicine in Tennessee.
The news release from the U.S. Attorney's Office refers to Rinehart as a former doctor.
Department of Justice units including the Medicare Fraud Strike Force and the Appalachian Regional Prescription Opioid Strike Force were involved in the investigation as was the federal Department of Health and Human Services the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and the local district attorney's office.

Educating children making overdose-reversing drugs available to all state troopers and adding hundreds of prison beds to treat those fighting opioid addiction are part of Gov. Bill Haslam and legislative leaders' comprehensive 30 million proposal to combat the epidemic.
The proposal comes as Tennessee continues to fight the ongoing crisis which now claims at least three lives a day in Tennessee. More than 1600 residents died from drug overdoses in 2016.
It is no secret our country faces a huge challenge in the opioid epidemic Haslam said at a Monday press conference unveiling the initiative. Tennessee unfortunately is not an exception to the problem.
The plan  dubbed TN Together  will be funded with both federal and state dollars and consist of three main components prevention treatment and law enforcement.
The largest component is focused on treatment. The proposal calls for 25 million in state and federal funding to be directed toward paying for treatment and recovery programs for people who cannot afford them.
Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services Commissioner Marie Williams said anywhere from 6000 to 10000 members of the public could be provided assistance with the new money.
We are also meeting with private providers to see if we can get them to invest into a public-provide leverage to expand that number Williams said adding the state has also served an additional 5000 people using federal dollars.
The latest estimates indicate as many as 300000 Tennesseans are misusing drugs with 82000 addicted to drugs she said.

The opioid plan also includes adding recovery specialists to emergency rooms and supplying naltrexone a medication that eases cravings for the drug to the state's drug recovery courts and county jails.
The biggest thing we hear is that funding is desperately needed for treatment programs said House Speaker Beth Harwell who last year convened a task force that examined the crisis. Only a fraction of those people get the treatment they need.
Treatment she said costs far less than any other option including incarceration.

The plan also calls for targeted outreach for women of childbearing age who are chronic opioid users in order to prevent births of children exposed to drugs in utero. The plan includes revisions to the state's health education standards in order to increase prevention education.
The plan also calls for comprehensive changes for law enforcement including adding new Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agents and equipping all state troopers with naloxone  the drug that reverses or blocks the effects of opioids after an overdose.
Karen Pershing executive director of the Knoxville-based Metro Drug Coalition praised the plans focus on prevention treatment and enforcement but noted it has a lack of true resource investment in primary prevention the focus of MDC and other grassroots coalitions around the state.
While I agree that equipping the Tennessee Highway Patrol officers with naloxone is possibly preventing overdose deaths the addiction has already taken place Pershing said. It was disappointing to not have any acknowledgement of the role anti-drug coalitions such as the Metro Drug Coalition play in local communities. There is currently no state funding designated for substance abuse prevention coalitions in Tennessee.
Pershing applauded the effort to bring treatment into jails and prisons calling it a relatively inexpensive way to get treatment to a lot of people quickly. But she said the need for more access to evidence-based addiction treatment services in Tennessee is tremendous.
On the prevention side the proposal includes a plan to limit an initial opioid prescription to a five-day supply with appropriate exceptions. Those exceptions would apply to TennCare enrollees as well.
The plan also calls for re-purposing 512 beds in the state's West Tennessee prison to expand drug treatment services. It also calls for the creation of a drug treatment program that would allow inmates who completed it to receive a reduced sentence and add new recovery courts for people convicted of nonviolent crimes who are addicted to drugs.
Judge Duane Sloan who operates a drug recovery court in northeast Tennessee said the extra treatment options will help all courts. He hopes funding can be made available to create residential recovery units for women going through his courtroom. There are far fewer slots for women than men across the state.
Shelby County Mayor Mark H. Luttrell Jr. noted the impact of the epidemic which once was centered in east Tennessee but has since become prevalent throughout the state.
Luttrell announced plans two weeks ago for a public awareness campaign led by the Health Department use of third-party health vendors to monitor prescriptions and continued review of potential litigation against the pharmaceutical industry.
The opioid issue affects countless people here in Shelby County which is why the Shelby County Health Department and our many partnering healthcare agencies have launched an aggressive campaign about the dangers of opioids he said.
The comprehensive proposal comes after months of discussion among state officials including lawmakers on how to combat the ongoing crisis.
Last year a bipartisan legislative task force convened by Harwell R-Nashville made a host of recommendations including
Adding 25 agents to the TBI
Establishing a commission to combat drug abuse and
Creating a consistent approach to determining drug overdose deaths
Not all of the legislative task force's recommendations appear to have made it into the latest proposal. Haslam and other officials declined to say how many TBI agents would be hired.
Tennessee Department of Health Commissioner John Dreyzehner said his agency will continue to work with medical examiners to improvement reporting on drug overdoses.
The opioid plan is among Haslam's top legislative priorities for the session and will likely be prominently featured in the governor's final State of the State speech which is set for Jan. 29.
Ahead of the news conference Tennessee Democratic Party chair Mary Mancini said any effort to address the opioid crisis needs to begin with expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
Sen. Jeff Yarbro D-Nashville and Rep. Mike Stewart D-Nashville who were among the dozens of lawmakers present for the announcement called the 25 million proposed to address treatment needs compared to funds that could be accessed through a Medicaid expansion in the state - a plan that has no Republican support.
Haslam and several of his Republican colleagues scoffed at the criticism.
Rep. Bill Dunn R-Knoxville said I applaud the governor for coming forward to have a solution. If people want to stand on the side and shoot at him they can but I don't have a whole lot of respect for that.
Calling past efforts to combat the opioid crisis successful Haslam said the latest proposal is simply a comprehensive plan that takes into account what has already been done in recent years.

The opioid crisis has been devastating to Tennessee. And it's getting worse.
More than 9100 people have died of drug overdoses in Tennessee between 2013 and 2018 according to state death data. More than 70 of those deaths were at least partially caused by opioids including prescription painkillers heroin or fentanyl.
The ongoing opioid crisis  the deadliest drug epidemic in American history  was largely sparked by the overprescription and abuse of prescription medications. Painkillers like OxyContin were prescribed frequently and in large dosages leading many patients to become dependent or addicted to these drugs.
PAINKILLERSThis pain clinic nurse gave a patient 51 pills a day. And she kept her license.
Tennessee later adopted laws and regulations to cut back these prescriptions but the damage was already done. People who had become addicted to prescription painkillers could still feed their addiction with heroin or black market pills.
Opioid prescriptions have now become weaker and less common in Tennessee but deaths have only grown.
As more people have flocked to the black market the drugs they use have become deadlier.
Heroin is chemically similar to prescription painkillers but far stronger and more dangerous. And heroin is often laced with fentanyl an exceptionally powerful synthetic opioid that is about 100 times more potent than morphine. A lethal dose is no larger than a few grains of sand.
Fentanyl was once virtually unknown outside of hospitals but has now grown to become one of the deadliest substances in America.
Why is our opioid crisis getting worse
You can pretty much explain it with a one-word answer fentanyl said Trevor Henderson Nashvilles opioid response coordinator.
HOW TO HELPNarcan a life-saving anti-overdose drug is now sold online in Tennessee
Many states have begun to turn a corner on the opioid crisis but Tennessee has not.
Nationwide overdose deaths dropped 2.2 between March 2018 and March 2019 according to the U.S. Census Bureau which tallies and estimates drug fatalities.
Deaths have also dropped dramatically in many of the states that have been hit hardest by the opioid crisis Ohio -12.4 Pennsylvania -11.5 Michigan -10.3 Florida -6.6 and Kentucky -8.2.
In Tennessee deaths rose 7.3 over the same period.
Those deaths are not entirely caused by opioids however.
This census data includes all drug deaths and Tennessee has also recorded a rise in deaths linked to methamphetamine and cocaine. Cocaine deaths dropped in 2018 but have risen overall since the opioid crisis began.
Many of these deaths are the result of intermingled drugs combining stimulants and opioids in a way that magnifies the danger of both according to law enforcement.
And fentanyl is increasingly found laced into not only heroin but also meth and cocaine.
We have been sounding the alarm and beating the drum so much trying to warn people that what they are buying may not be what it appears said T.J. Jordan assistant director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations drug division. What you take today may simply kill you tomorrow. And no one is heeding that warning.

Former Nashville Mayor Megan Barry is considering a bid for Congress in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District challenging incumbent U.S. Rep. Mark Green R-Clarksville.
I'm exploring a run for Congress and will decide in the coming weeks Barry said in a statement to The Tennessean on Wednesday. I believe Mark Green has repeatedly ignored the needs of Tennesseans as rural hospitals close and more people die from overdose deaths. He supports extreme bans on abortion and he and Congress have done nothing about gun violence. He deserves to be challenged.
Since the Republican-majority state legislature re-drew congressional redistricting lines in 2021 carving Nashville into three GOP-dominated congressional seats Music City has not had a representative in Congress who resides within Davidson County.
Incumbent U.S. Rep. John Rose whose district includes parts of northeast Nashville lives in Cookeville while U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles who represents parts of Antioch and south Nashville lives in Columbia.
Barry a Democrat was the first female mayor of Nashville elected in 2015 after two terms on the Metro Council. During her administration Barry advocated for a business-friendly socially progressive agenda.
She resigned from the office in 2018 after pleading guilty to felony theft related to a nearly two-year affair with a former police bodyguard Sgt. Rob Forrest. Barry was sentenced to three years of unsupervised probation and agreed to reimburse the city for 11000 in unlawful expenses. After completing three years of successful probation the charge was expunged from Barry's record in 2021.
Despite the affair and her resignation Barry has remained a prominent and well-respected voice in Nashville politics and has advocated for addiction research among other topics. Her son Max died of an opioid overdose while she was in office.
The Nashville Banner first reported Barry considering a congressional bid.
Green is a physician and retired U.S. Army major and was elected to Congress in 2018. He is currently chair of the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee. He is an outspoken advocate of U.S.-Mexican border security and military and veterans issues.
Green won reelection last year in the newly drawn 7th Congressional District which includes parts of North Nashville and northwestern Davidson County defeating progressive Nashville organizer Odessa Kelly 60 to 38. The district stretches from the Kentucky to border down to the state line with Alabama. Of the three members of Congress who represent Nashville Green is the only member to locate a field office in the city.
Last month Green launched a brief unsuccessful bid for U.S. House Speaker as Republicans struggled to coalesce around one candidate. He was eliminated in the second round of closed-door votes.
Prior to his election to Congress Green a served two terms in the Tennessee state legislature. Green was nominated for U.S. Secretary of the Army by then-President Donald Trump in 2017 but withdrew after drawing criticism for previous statements about gays lesbians and Muslims.
Election Day is Tuesday Nov. 5 2024.
KFF Health News 
Over the past two years rural Greene County in northeastern Tennessee has collected more than 2.7 million from regional and national settlements with opioid manufacturers and distributors. But instead of helping people harmed by addiction county officials are finding other ways to spend it.
They have put 2.4 million toward paying off the countys debt and have directed another 1 million arriving over more than a decade into a capital projects fund. In March they appropriated 50000 from that fund to buy a litter crew vehicle  a pickup truck to drive inmates to collect trash along county roads.
Its astounding said Nancy Schneck a retired nurse who has seen addiction infiltrate the community where employers avoid drug testing for fear of losing too many employees and mental health crises and homelessness are rampant. She wants to see the money go toward mental health and addiction treatment. Why cant county leaders see treating some people and maybe getting them out of this cycle might be advantageous she said.
In 2021 the latest year for which comparable data is available Greene Countys rate of drug overdose deaths topped state and national figures.
Greene County Tenn. resident Nancy Schneck wants opioid settlement funds to be used for addiction and mental health treatment. She says it's astounding that most of the money so far has gone to repaying county debt. Paul Ferrari
But Mayor Kevin Morrison said the county has borne the costs of the opioid epidemic for years It has funded a beleaguered sheriffs office improved the jail  which is packed with people whove committed addiction-related crimes  and supported a drug court to divert some people to treatment. It has also suffered indirect costs of the crisis people dropping out of the workforce due to addiction schools and welfare services caring for more children whove experienced trauma and some taxpayers leaving the county altogether. Addiction is not the sole reason for Greene Countys economic woes but it has contributed to more than 30 million of debt.
Weve been dealing with this crisis for quite some time but nobody wants to pay the bill as it comes Morrison said. So when these funds are made available then we are paying bills that have been due for quite some time.
The debate in this Appalachian county is reverberating nationwide as state and local governments receive billions of dollars from companies that made distributed or sold opioid painkillers like Johnson  Johnson Cardinal Health and CVS. The companies were accused of fueling the overdose epidemic and the money is meant to remediate that harm. About 3 billion has already landed in state county and city coffers and about 50 billion more is expected in the coming decade and beyond.
States are required to spend at least 85 of the money on opioid-related programs but KFF Health News ongoing investigation into how the cash is used  and misused  shows there is wide interpretation of that standard and little oversight.
That restriction didnt apply to the money Greene County moved to its capital projects fund.
In many rural communities which have been struggling to pay addiction-related costs for decades local officials justify using the settlement funds to reimburse past expenses. Most of Tennessees 95 counties are in significant debt which can present difficult choices about how to use this money said Robert Pack co-director of East Tennessee State Universitys Addiction Science Center.
Still he and many advocates hope the settlement funds are spent on tackling the current crisis. After all more than 200 people nationwide are dying of overdoses each day. Investing in treatment and prevention can save lives and protect future generations they say.
There is no good excuse to sit on the funds or put them into a general fund said Tricia Christensen policy director for the nonprofit Community Education Group. The organization is tracking settlement spending across Appalachia which Christensen called the epidemics ground zero. These dollars should be used to support people who have been most impacted by the overdose crisis.
Nationally there has been little oversight of the settlement dollars. President Joe Bidens administration pledged to ensure the funds went toward tackling the addiction crisis but has taken little action. Accountability at the state level varies.
In Tennessee 15 of the states opioid settlement funds are controlled by the legislature and another 15 by local governments. Those two buckets have few restrictions.
The other 70 is controlled by an Opioid Abatement Council which has more rigorous standards. When the council which must give 35 of its funds to local governments recently distributed more than 31 million to counties it required the funds be spent on a list of approved interventions such as building recovery housing and increasing addiction treatment for uninsured people.
I can guarantee were going to bird-dog those funds said Stephen Loyd chair of the council and a physician in recovery from opioid addiction. If counties use them for unapproved purposes the counties will not receive future payouts he said.
Greene County Tenn. is directing some of its opioid settlement money into the county's capital projects fund. In March 50000 from that fund was appropriated to buy a litter crew vehicle a pickup truck used to drive inmates assigned to collect trash by the side of the road. The new truck is not in use yet but looks just like this white truck the sheriff's office said. Greene County Sheriff's Office
Greene Countys reimbursement of its capital projects fund comes from its own pot  the 15 that is controlled entirely by local governments.
In such cases the public can hold officials accountable Loyd said. If you dont like the way the money is being spent you have the ability to vote.
Local leaders are generally not being nefarious with these decisions he said. They make hundreds of budgetary choices a month and simply dont have experience with addiction or health policy to guide them in using the money.
Loyd and other local experts are trying to fill that gap. He meets with county officials and recommends they speak with their local anti-drug coalitions or hold listening sessions to hear from community members. Pack from East Tennessee State urges them to increase access to medications that have proven effective in treating opioid addiction.
Both men point counties to an online recovery ecosystem index where leaders can see how their areas resources for recovery compare with those of others.
In Greene County for example the index indicates there are no recovery residences and the number of treatment facilities and mental health providers per 100000 residents is below state and national averages.
Thats a great place to get started Loyd said.
Some Greene County residents want to see opioid settlement funds go to local initiatives that are already operating on the ground. The Greene County Anti-Drug Coalition for instance hosts presentations to educate young people and their parents on the risks of drug use. They meet with convenience store owners to reinforce the importance of not selling alcohol cigarettes or vaping devices to minors. In the future the coalition hopes to offer classes on life skills such as how to budget and make decisions under pressure.
If we can do prevention work with kids we can change the trajectory of their lives as adults said Wendy Peay secretary of the anti-drug coalition and executive director of United Way of Greene County.
The coalition has asked the county for settlement funds but has not received any yet.
Nearby in Carter County a new residential treatment facility is taking shape at the site of a former prison. At least seven counties cities and towns in the region have committed a combined 10 million in opioid settlement funds to support it said Stacy Street a criminal court judge who came up with the idea. Greene County is among the few local governments that did not contribute.
The facility which Street said he expects to open this summer will initially house 45 people for stays of a year or longer. It will be part of the regions drug recovery court system in which people with addiction who have committed crimes are diverted to intensive treatment instead of prison.
Currently there are no long-term residential facilities in the area for such patients Street said. Too often people in his court receive treatment during the day but return home at night to the same sandbox playing with the same sand-mates increasing their risk of relapse.
Street said the new facility will not offer medications to treat opioid addiction  the gold standard of medical care  because of security concerns. But some patients may be taken to receive them off campus.

Morrison the Greene County mayor said he worried about contributing to the facility because it is a recurring cost and the settlement funds will stop flowing in 2038.
Theres been great pressure put on local entities like Greene County to try to solve this problem with this limited amount of funding he said when the federal government which has the ability to print money to solve these problems is not in this business.
The county is still deciding how to spend nearly 334000 of settlement funds it recently received from the states Opioid Abatement Council. Morrison said theyre considering using it for the anti-drug coalitions education efforts and the county drug court. Given the guidelines from the abatement council these funds cant be used to pay old debts.
The drug overdose crisis in Davidson County continues to escalate experts say and members of the Metro Council's Public Health and Safety Committee are seeking ways to curb the death toll.
On Thursday evening at Nashville's Historic Metro Courthouse three experts on the front lines of the fight against drug overdose deaths presented to the committee including Mary Linden Salter executive director of the Tennessee Association of Alcohol Drug and other Addiction Services Josh Love an epidemiologist with the drug overdose response unit in the Metro Health Department and DeWayne Holman executive director of the Nashville Prevention Partnership.
Fatal drug overdoses in Tennessee have accelerated sharply since the early- to mid-2010s. In 2020 the most recent year data is available the state recorded over 3000 overdose deaths an increase of 44 compared to 2019 and Tennessees deadliest year ever. Preliminary data suggested that the state was on pace to exceed that number in 2021.
But Councilmember Erin Evans the committee chair who organized the meeting said the committee has typically discussed the epidemic only when accepting grants rarely focusing on the awareness side of things. That changed on Thursday night.
Salter explained the science behind addiction. Addiction is a disease she said. With addiction treatment what we try to do is reprogram the brain and find opportunities where we can teach people new skills and help them use new neuropathways.
She lauded legislation that would enhance efforts to combat the crisis including a bill that would widen access to naloxone in Tennessee.
But Salter also called on committee members to help address the states provider shortage in addiction recovery treatment. Figuring out how to build a more robust workforce would be extremely helpful she said.
Love presented data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention comparing Tennessee and Davidson County to peer communities across the nation. Tennessee he said ranks fourth nationwide in overdose death rates and sixth nationwide in the number of annual overdose deaths.

Meanwhile a Metro Health Department analysis of CDC data found that of the nations 3100 counties Davidson ranked 30th in the total number of overdose deaths reported.
Love attributed the crisis in large part to the rise of fentanyl a highly potent opioid that is inexpensive and easy to produce. Lethal even in very small quantities fentanyl often comes mixed with other substances or in the form of counterfeit pills leading to accidental overdoses by people who believe they are taking a different drug.
The Davidson County District Attorneys office estimates that two out of every five counterfeit pills seized contain a lethal dose of fentanyl Love said.
PreviouslyDrug overdoses killed more Tennesseans than ever last year fentanyl deaths up 70 percent
Committee members also learned about the wide range of support and harm reduction programs in place for residents of Davidson County. Holmans presentation included a discussion of spike alerts by text which track a communitys overdose patterns and the Tennessee REDLINE a free 247 hotline for addiction treatment referrals.
These programs and other similar initiatives could soon see an influx of funding. Mayor John Coopers office announced on Thursday that Davidson County will receive 23 million from the multibillion-dollar settlement between local governments and the nations largest opioid manufacturers and distributors. The state of Tennessee and its counties collectively will receive 613 million.
At-large Council member Sharon Hurt thanked the speakers for their efforts to combat the drug crisis.
The work that theyre doing is invaluable she said. It is making a difference in our community.
A sedative drug used for animals is now showing up on the streets of Nashville causing public health concerns.
The mitigations of Xylazine is starting to show up as the cause of death in autopsies as well as in drug busts Metro Police's top drug officer says. The drug is meant to be used as a sedative for animals such as cattle and not approved for human consumption.
The issue with this new drug is you can't override the affects of it with Narcan like you can with other drugs. Xylazine can reportedly leave open sores and even cause the removal of limbs if it doesn't take you life first.
One Metro Council member said he saw the effects of this drug first hand when he visited a homeless camp in his district.
I've recently had a homeless camp closed in my district says Metro Councilmember Jordan Huffman. And I have seen what Xylazine does to the human body first hand. Going in these camps and seeing the decay and the loss of limbs is extremely traumatic. Not only just or those who see it but my goodness the people that have to deal with it.
Metro Police Sergeant Mike Hotz says about 80 of the fentanyl tested in their crime lab tested positive for Xylazine. He notes the amounts the lab saw were traced meaning Xylazine is present in the drug supply but not necessarily in quantities large enough to have the narcotic effect to get a person high.
Unfortunately in my personal and professional opinion the Xylazine is here on scene in Nashville's drug supply and that poses significant public health and public safety issues to our citizens says Sergeant Hotz. And it creates not only a problem for treatment of substance use disorder but it also creates other public health problems with the open wounds.
Sergeant Hotz says Metro Police believes Xylazine is coming in from the Southern border from places like Mexico and Central America. It is being sold along with fentanyl as well as mixed in with drugs such as meth.
Xylazine has been on the State of Tennessee's radar since 2022 according to Metro Police. Now it is being seen in areas across Nashville.
Doctors at Vanderbilt Medical University Center have been made aware of this new public health issue. They appreciate Metro Police informing them of the problem so medical professionals can start collecting data on how best to treat the significant wounds.

Overdose deaths attributed to meth and cocaine have risen dramatically four years in a row
Narcotics investigators say Tennessee is flooded with cheap potent meth smuggled from Mexican super labs
The sun wasnt up yet when the cops surrounded the storage unit in Clarksville.
Two weeks of sleuthing had built to this moment. Narcotics investigators had intercepted a street-level meth sale in Kentucky then backtracked the dealers supply through a few stash houses and across the state line. And now poised outside this storage unit they hoped to find a mother lode hidden inside.
They werent disappointed. When the raid was over and the sun had risen investigators had found more than 54 pounds of bright white crystal meth. It had been cooked in a Mexican drug lab more than a thousand miles away then smuggled to Tennessee where it would be worth more than 2 million on the street.
This was a very very large amount of methamphetamine said David Thompson director of the Pennyrile Narcotics Task Force which led the drug investigation. And there is no doubt that these are cartel drugs.
This meth seizure which occurred June 20 was one of the biggest Tennessee drug busts in years and a victory for law enforcement in a seemingly endless war on dangerous narcotics. But the bust also illustrates how methamphetamine trafficking in Tennessee has evolved making drugs cheaper more dangerous and more difficult to stop according to narcotics investigators throughout the state.
FENTANYLFor years heroin has been the deadliest drug in Nashville. Not anymore.
Cartel meth killed hundreds in 2017
A decade ago most of Tennessees meth was cooked in small batches made in countless ramshackle labs hidden in the states rural stretches. But today investigators said the state is flooded with stronger cheaper meth smuggled from industrial-style cartel labs in Mexico. That same smuggling infrastructure also carries cocaine another cartel drug that largely piggybacks on the meth trade.
And as this smuggling operation has grown the results have been deadly. Deaths attributed to overdoses on meth cocaine and other stimulants have risen dramatically over the past four years according to recent statistics from the Tennessee Department of Health. Cocaine deaths mostly concentrated in Nashville Memphis and Knoxville have increased by at least 20 percent annually reaching 306 last year. Deaths involving meth and other stimulants which are spread widely throughout the state increased by at least 50 percent annually peaking at 319.
Knoxville appears to have been hit the hardest. According to the state statistics cocaine deaths in Knox County more than doubled from 26 in 2016 to 55 in 2017. Meth deaths also grew  from 22 to 46.
Sgt. Joshua Shaffer supervisor of the Knoxville police drug task force said the city had long struggled with cocaine but now Knoxville is swamped with so much cheap potent meth that even longtime cocaine addicts have begun to swap drugs.
As far as drugs on our streets there has been a significant increase in crystal methamphetamine Shaffer said. The super labs in Mexico are pumping it out by the tons really.
Meth cocaine and the opioid crisis
In addition to the rising potency and availability of cartel drugs the deaths caused by meth and cocaine are deeply intertwined with Tennessees ongoing opioid crisis which killed at least 1268 people in the state in 2017. Overdose statistics make it exceedingly difficult to determine how these deaths overlap but the narcotics investigators interviewed for this story said they believe many deaths are the result of addicts mixing opioids and stimulants commonly known as speedballing.
Stimulants are an essential part of this deadly cocktail but theyve largely fallen out of the spotlight as public awareness has shifted toward combating the opioid crisis said Tommy Farmer special agent in charge of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations drug division. When the public attention shifted political will and police priorities were quick to follow.
We got worn out with meth stories Farmer said when asked about public interest in drug enforcement beyond the opioid crisis. But we have to remind ourselves that methamphetamine is a tremendously strong addictive drug and that the states appetite for this drug hasnt ever gone away.
MORETennessees prescription pill addiction is getting better but fentanyl looms large
Meth labs are gone meth never left
Meth has long been a widespread problem in Tennessee but years ago state law enforcement found themselves fighting the war on drugs on their home turf. Between 2002 and 2012 more than 16000 meth labs were discovered in Tennessee with many hidden in the states rural counties using the wilderness to cover the foul smoke and stench produced by mixing chemicals. Small-time cooks also were known to mix meth in 2-liter soda bottles  often called the Shake and Bake method  which required virtually no lab equipment and could even be done in a moving car.
But in 2013 state lawmakers enacted strict laws limiting the purchase of cold and allergy medicines containing pseudoephedrine sometimes called meth precursors which are often used as base ingredients in meth labs. Some Tennessee cities went even further requiring prescriptions for all medicines containing pseudoephedrine.
Almost immediately Tennessees meth trade began to change. Drug dealers who had long been able to buy pseudoephedrine with ease could no longer get the bulk ingredients needed to cook meth. Within two years the number of meth labs discovered in the state had dropped from hundreds per month to only a few dozen according to the Tennessee Dangerous Drugs Task Force.
There were a lot of people who say Oh weve done it. We won the war on meth  Farmer said. But we were very cautious because we knew we couldnt do it overnight.
Soon it was become apparent that Tennessee hadnt won any war at all.
Although meth cooks could no longer get enough precursor drugs to run labs Tennessee still had a strong demand for what had long been its drug of choice. Meanwhile Mexican cartels that had traditionally trafficked marijuana were now shifting their focus onto meth. Soon cartel labs were producing meth that was far more potent than anything that had been cooked in Tennessee.
Overdose deaths have been on the rise ever since.
It kind of was a perfect storm said Sgt. Gene Donegan a narcotics investigator with Metro Nashville Police. We passed the regulatory laws on Sudafed  and at the same time the cartels had gotten better with their manufacturing.
Nowadays meth flows from cartel labs beyond the reach of American law enforcement and Tennessee police find themselves shifting focus from small labs hidden in the wilderness to secret smugglers on crisscrossing highways. Sometimes they intercept huge shipments like that mother lode discovered in Clarksville in June.
I know there are a couple of busts that have gotten 20 or 30 or 40 pounds Donegan said. Back when people were doing the Shake and Bake method if you caught them with an ounce that was a lot of meth.
But now like I said weve got pounds and pounds and pounds of it.

Two people have been charged in connection with the drug overdose death of a 23-month-old child after a year-long investigation by Metro Nashville police.
Jesse Mashburn 36 and Melissa Sutton 46 were indicted by a grand jury after investigators said the toddler they were caring for Ariel Rose died of fentanyl ingestion on Nov. 11 2022 inside the Highroad Transitional Living Facility on 25th Avenue North.
The toddler had previously been living in the Brookmeade homeless encampment before her death according to other media reports.
Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid about 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times more potent than heroin.
Mashburn and Sutton were arrested Wednesday in a Hermitage apartment complex. Both are being held on 100000 bond.
Rose's grandfather Mickey Rose is suing Highroad Transitional Living Facility and Sutton as Ariel's babysitter saying both had obligations to keep the toddler away from drugs. He's seeking at least 15 million in damages court records show.
These places are supposed to help turn people's lives around Rose's attorney Isaac Kimes said in July. And very clearly as delineated in the lawsuit there were drugs running through this place like a river. And police were called out there I mean what we found in 2022 from January 1 until the day Ariel was found dead it was well over 100 times.
The lawsuit noted that Ariel was in the custody of her aunt but the woman had placed her in the care of her father Jonathan Rose who was living at the facility.
On the day of Ariel's death Jonathan Rose asked Sutton to watch the child the lawsuit said claiming that Sutton was a frequent user of illegal drugs. It claims the child came into contact with fentanyl in Sutton's room at some point.

A Tennessee man has been charged with the death of his 23-month-old son who died in October from a fentanyl-related fatal overdose the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department MNPD has announced.
Kelvin Blaylock Jr. 22 was issued with criminal homicide and aggravated child neglect warrants on Thursday by youth services detectives who had been investigating the death of his son for the last three months the MNPD said in a statement.
Blaylock called 911 on Oct. 3 to report that he had woken up inside an Ireland Street residence and found his son Kashton Blaylock unresponsive. The childs mother had dropped their son off to be in his fathers care while she went to work.

Officers responded to the scene and Kashton Blaylock was rushed to Centennial Medical Center where he was pronounced deceased
An autopsy determined that the cause of his death was due to the toxic effects of fentanyl and metonitazene a relatively new high-potency synthetic opioid also known by the street name pyro which is increasing in prevalence in the U.S. It is unclear how the child managed to consume the drugs.
During an interview Wednesday Blaylock admitted to using heroin two hours before finding his son unresponsive the MNPD said.

More than 79000 Americans 55 and older died from an opioid overdose between 1999 and 2019 according to a recently released Senate report.
The rate of overdose deaths increased from 3 per 100000 in 2002 to 12 per 100000 in 2021 the report reads.
Tennessees counties received 31.4 million from the states opioid abatement council in the first round of payments set to occur yearly over the next two decades.
The money comes as Tennessee ranked No. 2 in drug overdose deaths in 2021 based on population with an estimated 3813 people dying according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.
Lawmakers set up an abatement council to distribute what could be nearly 1 billion in settlement funds from opioid manufacturers and distributors to address Tennessees overdose crisis in part caused by them.
The states first round of money comes from a 600 million pot paid over 18 years by AmerisourceBergen Cardinal Health McKesson and Johnson  Johnson. Tennessee could also have access to another 490 million if proposed settlements with Allergan CVS Teva Walgreens and Walmart go through.
State law requires that 35 of the settlement fund are directly given to counties with the other 65 set aside for grant programs.
As part of the county funds the state set up a distribution formula for giving the money out based on the impact of the opioid crisis in each community.
Across the United States drug manufacturers and distributors have agreed to nearly 50 billion in settlement payments related to their role in causing the opioid crisis.
KFF News a nonprofit health news publication created a database to track the professionals deciding how the money would be spent.
The councils makeup could play a critical role in whether money is spent on prevention and harm-reducing programs versus policing activities.
KFF found that Tennessees council has a higher percentage of law enforcement and criminal justice officials on the council than in other states.
But some restrictions are already in place for how counties can spend their settlement money. They have a list of 12 programs they can choose from.
The abatement council  created in 2021  is a 13-member body with appointments by the governor Senate speaker House Speaker the Tennessee County Services Associations and the state municipal league.
Marie Williams LCSW gratefully serves as Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services TDMHSAS. She was reappointed to her position by Governor Bill Lee on January 19 2019 and was initially appointed by Gov. Bill Haslam effective October 22 2016.
As Commissioner Ms. Williams oversees and leads the department in its role as the states public mental health and substance abuse authority. Under her leadership and with support from two different governors and the Tennessee General Assembly the TDMHSAS annual budget has grown from 337 million to about 730 million. In all the department serves approximately 750000 Tennesseans annually who are struggling with mental health and substance abuse issues. Ms. Williams provides leadership and oversight to more than 1850 full-time employees who assist individuals in securing prevention treatment and recovery services for serious mental illness serious emotional disturbances and substance abuse disorders. Her duties as commissioner also include system planning monitoring licensing evaluating and setting policy and quality standards collaborating with other state and community agencies and working to educate the community about mental health and substance abuse services. Ms. Williamss oversight responsibilities include about 1000 contracts with community mental health and substance abuse providers the operation of four regional mental health institutes with about 8000 annual admissions and contracts with three additional private psychiatric hospitals which serve about 3000 people annually.
In her time as Commissioner Ms. Williams has served as a leader in addressing several essential issues facing Tennessee including behavioral health workforce challenges mental health struggles of youth and young adults the opioid crisis criminal justice reform leveraging the abilities and resources of the faith-based community and expanding peer-led services but her career in behavioral health services has been marked by a special passion for housing.
Commissioner Williams began her career in Memphis Tennessee supporting people experiencing homelessness and mental illness. Her success there led to employment with TDMHSAS starting in 2000 as the Director of Housing Planning and Development. Her signature achievement the Creating Homes Initiative CHI has leveraged more than 1 billion and developed more than 32000 supportive housing options for people diagnosed with mental illness and co-occurring disorders. Based on the success of the original CHI program Governor Bill Lee and the Tennessee General Assembly expanded it twice to create housing for people recovering from substance use disorder CHI 2.0 and re-entering communities from incarceration CHI 3.0.
As the pandemic realities of workforce disruption burnout and uncertainty facing all sectors of the economy became clear Commissioner Williams convened and led a workgroup to study the issue gather data and establish solutions. The workgroup included representatives from treatment provider agencies consumer and family advocacy groups as well as universities and colleges that train the professionals working in the field. She also leveraged relationships at the states Medicaid agency to ensure that the entire sphere of public behavioral health was represented. Under Ms. Williamss leadership this diverse group of stakeholders developed a roadmap for Tennessees elected decisionmakers to consideration that eventually led to an additional 36 million recurring investment of state dollars for TDMHSAS contracted providers.
Another reality of the pandemic that Commissioner Williams realized early on was the outsized impact on the mental health of Tennessees youth and young adults. With support from Governor Bill Lee and the Tennessee General Assembly and in partnership with the departments contracted community mental health providers Ms. Williams created the Childrens Behavioral Health Safety Net. In the model of the existing Behavioral Health Safety Net for adults the Childrens BHSN ensured that any Tennessee child who was uninsured or underinsured would have access to essential outpatient mental health services. Commissioner Williams also led the expansion of the departments services for children and youth taking the School-Based Behavioral Health Liaison program from a few dozen counties to statewide and initiating the Tennessee Resiliency Project which allowed grant applicants unprecedented latitude in designing services to meet the need in their areas. Her leadership and decision making are essential as the department works to operationalize Governor Bill Lees 250 million K-12 Mental Health Trust Fund.
Under the direction of Gov. Bill Haslam Ms. Williams co-chaired a workgroup of commissioners state and local lawmakers and law enforcement officers to develop a comprehensive plan to address opioid addiction and reduce overdose deaths in Tennessee. This plan became known as TN Together and was the signature policy initiative of Gov. Haslams final year in office. The 30 million plan addressed the crisis by making significant investments in substance abuse treatment addiction prevention and law enforcement. Since then Ms. Williams has continued to advocate for expanded funding for prevention treatment and recovery services with more than 30 million in state funding added under the administration of Governor Bill Lee and more than 150 million in awarded federal grants since March 2020. As lawsuit settlements stemming from the opioid crisis send hundreds of millions of dollars to Tennessee Ms. Williamss leadership remains key as she serves as a non-voting member of the states Opioid Abatement Council.
Ms. Williamss efforts in criminal justice reform include advocating increasing funding and expanding the network of recovery courts to encompass 84 recovery courts in Tennessee with dozens more mental health courts starting operation soon. Additionally Ms. Williams is responsible for leadership and oversight of the departments juvenile justice program which created alternatives to out-of-home placements in areas of the state where options are limited. In 2019 Governor Bill Lee called on Commissioner Williamss leadership to chair the Behavioral Health Subcommittee of his Criminal Justice Investment Task Force. Additionally Ms. Williams has provided criminal justice leadership at the national level serving with the Council of State Governments Justice Center Advisory Board since 2018 and serving as the groups Chair starting in 2022.
Faith in God has always been a strong motivator for Ms. Williams as she moved through her personal and professional life and that influence showed her the value of direct outreach to communities of all faiths across Tennessee. During her time as Deputy Commissioner Ms. Williams helped create the Departments Faith-Based Initiative and under her leadership as Commissioner the initiative grew to encompass two department employees and four regional Faith-Based Community Coordinators. The programs signature achievement is Certified Recovery Congregation program which has certified more than 1000 houses of faith to create and share recovery resources and support Tennesseans in their journey of wellness.
Increasing the role of peer-led services has been a significant theme of Ms. Williamss time as Commissioner. Under her leadership programs in the department have been started andor greatly expanded that have placed Certified Peer Recovery Specialists in places where they can refer people to treatment work with communities of faith work inside of emergency departments train people on reversing overdose and more. Commissioner Williams responded to the demand for certified peers both from within the departments programs and from community providers and other settings by greatly increasing capacity in the departments CPRS trainings. As a result Tennessee reached a milestone with more than 1200 active CPRS during her tenure as Commissioner.
In her previous position as Deputy Commissioner Ms. Williams served as top advisor to the Commissioner and managed the departmental budget of more than 337 million. Ms. Williams successfully assisted in the departments transformation initiative which closed a 150-bed long-term care facility. Through strong partnership and collaboration with community providers all patients were transitioned into community-based care and the facilitys previous operating budget of 20.5 million was reinvested into community-based services. Ms. Williamss leadership secured the support of three East Tennessee private psychiatric in-patient hospital partners to provide services to those patients previously served by Lakeshore Mental Health Institute.
Commissioner Williams is the recipient of numerous professional and community awards from national and state groups including the Excellence in Advocacy Individual Achievement Award from the National Council for Behavioral Health the George Goodman and Ruth P. Brudney National Social Work Award from Mental Health America the Alumni Professional Achievement Award from the University of Tennessee Knoxville the Vision of Hope Award from NAMI Tennessee the Senator Douglas Henry Award for Service to Children and Families at Risk from the University of Tennessee College of Social Work. Ms. Williams lives in Nashville and she is the mother of Nikki Williams.

5 deaths linked to heroin in Nash County
NASHVILLE NC WTVD -- Nash County Sheriff Keith Stone says five people have died of heroin overdoses in the past week.
It's an ongoing problem. Stone told the Wilson Times that he's seeing EMS workers called out at least three times a week for overdoses and some die.
He explained that prescription drug addiction leads to snorting heroin which leads to injecting heroin. Overdoses happen frequently with injecting.
Stone is doing what he can. In 2015 there were 50 arrests in the county related to heroin.
Heroin is killing people - good people Stone told the Times. It not only destroys the person who uses it it affects everybody they are in contact with like their families.

Epidemic brings higher medical jail costs and deflates work productivity
'Substance use disorder is killing our future'
Substance abuse annually costs Tennessee more than 2 billion  more than half of which is attributed to lost income from people who have fallen out of the labor market according to an economist.
The substance abuse epidemic  most notably involving opioids  raises questions about access to treatment how to stem the illicit use of prescription painkillers and staunch the use of illegal drugs.
MoreInvestigation How many lives are lost to opioids No one knows.
But the economic impact is less understood and not generally a component of policy discussions.
Teresa Waters chair of preventive medicine at University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center who leads a policy research group dug into the costs associated with substance abuse.
The 2 billion cost to Tennessee includes
46 million for babies born in the state with neonatal abstinence syndrome
422.5 million for hospitalizations associated with opioid abuse and
138 million for hospitalizations with alcohol listed as the first diagnosis.
But at 1.29 billion the lost income from having an estimated 31000 people or 1 percent of the workforce out of jobs is the biggest component.
Waters expected the economic impact to be sizable but was still surprised by the final tally  especially given the decision to take a conservative approach to the analysis.
When I put it all together I was like 'wow.' It's striking. It's a wake-up call that this is not just a sad story. This is an economic story said Waters.
Epidemic brings higher medical jail costs and deflates work productivity
Waters started her analysis after talking with Dr. David Stern vice-chancellor for clinical affairs for the University of Tennessees College of Medicine and the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center.
MoreOpioid epidemic 'getting worse instead of better' public health officials warn
Stern wants to create a program for new physicians to be trained in addiction medicine and wanted to put the cost of his proposal in context with what abuse costs the state.
Waters said she took a conservative approach to the analysis so the overall economic impact and state spending is likely higher. In fact she didn't include costs associated with substance abuse overdoses because of debate over how to estimate economic impact from early loss of life.
I dont think this is completely comprehensive. Its really the most obvious areas said Waters.
Nationally the opioid epidemic cost the U.S. economy more than 504 billion in 2015 the White Houses Council of Economic Advisers projected in a November study.
In most states there is a dearth of qualified physicians with training in addiction medicine  and there are expensive ramifications said John Donahue CEO of Axial Healthcare a start-up in Nashville that works with insurers to identify over-prescription and people at risk for addiction.
Patients that Axial has identified as high risk for opioid abuse use 300 percent more health care services than patients who are not seeking opioids Donahue said. The spending comes down when people get into treatment.
Waters spends a lot of her time looking at health care financing and the cost effectiveness of medical treatment. She'll be leaving Memphis soon to be the chair of the department of health management at policy at University of Kentucky College of Public Health.
The disconnect between treatments for physical and mental health is an impediment to getting people help said Waters.
She wants people to understand the nexus between health and economy  the costs it brings to the state.
In a separate analysis Waters estimates that the state spends 273 million annually on effects drug and alcohol-related health problems and crimes. When combined with lost sales tax revenue the cost is 513 million to the state budget.
TennCare spent 41.4 million on incremental costs related to babies born with NAS according to a 2017 report  a figure that's been on the rise over the last several years.
Hospitalizations associated with opioid abuse cost TennCare 76.9 million per 2015 data.
Adult incarceration for drug and alcohol related offenses cost nearly 123 million in 2015.
'Substance use disorder is killing our future'
With 1 percent of the workforce out of work due to substance abuse the state loses out on 239.4 million in annual sales tax revenue.
And Waters thinks there are probably more people out of work because of substance abuse or at least working at lower levels of productivity.
Having people in the prime of work years ages 20s through their 40s out of work brings long-term consequences for the state and families.
These folks are losing their education losing their ability to work productively said Waters. That's a huge huge loss.
Waters hopes the economic impact of the epidemic drives more state lawmakers to think of the issue as more than tragedy for families but as a roadblock to a healthy state in the coming years.
It's really our future. Substance use disorder is killing our future. We want to bring in more jobs to Tennessee. We want to have a stronger workforce said Waters. If we want to attract Amazon these big companies we have to have a strong workforce.

An emotional statement released by the mayor and her husband Bruce Barry said their son died in Denver on Saturday night.
Early this morning we received news that no parents should ever have to hear. Our son Max suffered from an overdose and passed away. We cannot begin to describe the pain and heartbreak that comes with losing our only child. Our son was a kind soul full of life and love for his family and friends the statement said. Our family would greatly appreciate your thoughts and prayers and would respectfully ask for privacy as we mourn the loss of our child and begin to understand a world without his laughter and love in our lives.
Max Barry graduated in June from the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma Washington. It is unclear what exactly he overdosed on.
Funeral arrangements were pending as of Sunday and will be announced once plans are made the mayor's office said.
With her husband and son by her side Megan Barry was sworn in as Nashville's first female mayor in September 2015.
Denver Police Department spokeswoman Raquel Lopez declined to search the department's records and logs for the police report of Barry's death when asked by The Associated Press saying that would violate the department's policy of not identifying victims.

In recent years Tennessee policymakers have enacted a series of measures to combat the state's growing opioid problem
2015 Lawmakers enact legislation tightening the requirements for medical directors and owners of pain management clinics. The new law requires medical directors or owners of pain clinics to be licensed physicians who hold required continuing medical education and sub-specialty certifications in pain medicine.
2015 The Intractable Pain Treatment Act is repealed with the support of the states district attorneys and the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. The 2001 measure included a Pain Patients Bill of Rights which gave patients a great amount of responsibility to choose opiate medications as a first line of treatment and physicians were required either to provide requested opiate medication or refer patients to physicians who would.
2014 Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam announces a seven-point plan to address the state's opioid abuse problem that includes public education law enforcement and regulatory oversight of the medical community.
2014 New guidelines issued by the Tennessee Department of Health set limits on the daily doses of opioids doctors may prescribe and spell out protocols for giving the drugs to women of child-bearing age and establish new certification requirements for pain medication specialists.
2013 Dispensing of controlled substances by pain management clinics is prohibited.
2013 Tennessee begins to require health care professionals to check the Controlled Substance Monitoring Database before prescribing a controlled substance.
2013 Legislation limits to 30 days prescriptions for drugs categorized as Schedule II and Schedule III which include a range of opioid medications. The law also requires physicians to perform urine drug tests if they prescribe these medications beyond 30 days.
2013 A new law to combat prescription fraud requires medical professionals to use tamper-resistant paper for all written prescriptions.
2012 The Prescription Safety Act sponsored by Sen. Ken Yager R-Harriman is the first sweeping legislation to address opioid abuse. It expanded the required use of the state's prescription drug database originally created as a research tool requiring pharmacists to check the database before filling prescriptions update the database once a week instead of once per month and making the database available to law enforcement. The law also allowed pharmacists and the Department of Health to share prescription information across state lines and elevated some types of doctor-shopping to a felony.
